Click: How to Encourage Clicks Without Shady Tricks (2020)

Paul Boag

───────────────

▪ Just think about your own experience of buying something on Amazon. Search for almost any product on Amazon and you see an overwhelming number of options. So how do you narrow those options? Most of us filter by price and, more importantly, rating.

▪ First, it connects disgruntled customers. It is easy for customers who have had bad experiences with the same company to connect and act together. Most famously, one disgruntled Dell customer unified others dissatisfied with the company’s customer service by publishing a blog post, “Dell Lies. Dell Sucks6.” The resulting PR backlash reportedly knocked a third off of the company’s share price7.

▪ But are we actually caught in a vicious circle? Could it be that the very reason consumers are less willing to buy and more resistant to marketing is because we are undermining trust with the manipulative techniques we adopt?

▪ Then there is the cost of processing returns. For a physical product this can become very expensive as restocking a product can be both time-consuming and in some cases impossible. Even if it is not a physical product, there is still the cost of processing refunds or handling disputes when a refund is not going to be issued.

▪ Not that all manipulative techniques used online are focused on placing an order. Newsletter sign-up is another common area where dark patterns lurk. Surely there is no cost to buyer’s remorse there?

▪ So that leaves us with a problem. If we cannot use dark patterns, then what is the alternative? What was the head of e-commerce at Acme Electronics supposed to do? What are you supposed to do if you are in a similar position?

The first step is to reevaluate how we measure success. We need to look carefully at the metrics we use.

▪ I went to book the flights. After a somewhat frustrating experience, I eventually found the flights I wanted and proceeded to check out. I reached the payment page before I realized the airline had sneakily added travel insurance to my order. Coverage I neither required nor requested.

▪ I am certainly not alone in feeling this way, especially about the travel sector. It has reached the point where government bodies are intervening. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced:

“The CMA has taken enforcement action to bring to an end misleading sales tactics, hidden charges and other practices in the online hotel booking market. These have been wholly unacceptable.”2

▪ The investigation that followed identified some concerns mainly focusing on the use of psychological manipulation to encourage impulsive bookings; in particular, the tendency of these sites to inflate the popularity of a hotel to push users to act quickly.

▪ And this is not a problem limited to the travel sector. It increasingly feels like most websites set out to manipulate consumers into doing something. These practices have become so commonplace they now have a name: dark patterns3. The term “dark pattern” was coined by Harry Brignull and refers to a user interface element that is carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they might not otherwise do.

▪ The thing is, dark patterns work, even when you know a site is trying to manipulate you. I might have known that the hotel site was trying to trick me, but on a subconscious level it would still work, and the company would see an increase in their conversion level because of this dark pattern.

▪ Design cues combined with the fact that most users do not read instructions can trick them into taking certain actions.

▪ The design takes advantage of the fact that users are often in too much of a rush to read copy properly and instead rely on visual cues to work out what they should do next.

▪ The subject of ethics in web design is hotly championed by many passionate individuals but it’s not the topic of this book. I take a more pragmatic attitude toward the whole subject. When the pressure is on, people can convince themselves anything is ethical and justify whatever they feel they need to do.

▪ It is important to remember that many digital professionals are under massive pressure from management to improve online conversion rates. You might even be one of them. In such situations, preaching ethics isn’t going to change people’s behavior, because people under pressure can convince themselves of anything. After all, even my example above makes it very clear that it adds insurance to an order, so how can it be unethical? I went as far as writing it on the button!

▪ If we are to stamp out dark patterns and make the web a better place, we need to talk about more than ethical considerations. We need to provide management with a solid business argument against their use, and offer a viable alternative.

▪ Not only that, but they also have instant access to everything everybody has ever said online about those universities. While my knowledge was limited to what a university told me about itself, they can access the opinions of students who attend or have attended the university, as well as details of any accreditation and awards they have received.

▪ What a huge difference. A difference that applies to pretty much any product you care to mention and which has fundamentally redefined the relationship between customers and brands. But also, a change that has altered consumer behavior.

▪ Consumers love choice – or to be more accurate, consumers say they love choice. In truth, based on countless studies, we often deal with choice extremely poorly. Making a decision becomes overwhelming due to the many potential outcomes and risks that may result from making the wrong choice. We find choosing mentally draining and often fail to make a decision at all.

▪ Hick’s law5 (named after psychologist William Edmund Hick) states that there is a direct correlation between the number of choices and the length of time it will take us to reach a decision.

▪ Our response to this overwhelming choice is to reduce our options to something more manageable as rapidly as possible. That leads us to dismiss options based on very superficial criteria. For example, if a website loads too slowly there is no reason why users need to hang around; they move on to the next possible supplier.

▪ Not that consumers are entirely without help in narrowing their options. There has been an explosion of sites offering feedback on companies from other customers. Ratings and reviews have become a critical component in people’s decision-making process.

▪ Not only do consumers have more choice than ever before, they also have a voice. If you go back 25 years, there were very few consequences if a company provided a customer with a poor experience. In most cases it would be limited to the customer moaning about the company to friends and family.

▪ Facebook in particular has come in for a lot of criticism for its manipulative techniques. But the stories around the manipulation employed by tech companies are educating consumers about the broader and more entrenched culture of manipulation that has existed in sales and marketing for generations.

▪ Of course, to use less manipulative techniques, we first need to persuade our clients or managers that this is a better approach.

▪ Those who propose the use of dark patterns are not bad people in most cases. They are people under pressure to meet targets and keep a business growing. They resort to manipulation out of what they see as a necessity. For them, dark patterns are an answer to the challenges they face. After all, they do work and will indeed increase sales.

▪ The problem is that dark patterns come with costs that are not immediately apparent to a manager or client under pressure. Costs that are ultimately damaging to the business as a whole. Costs that often go unidentified, leaving management under the impression they make sense.

▪ What are the business costs of dark patterns? They fall into two areas:

•the enormous impact of buyer’s remorse

▪ •the hidden marketing costs of manipulation

▪ This is especially true when seen against the general backdrop where advertising spend seems to be becoming less and less effective. The need to convert customers is therefore higher than ever. With customers seemingly more reluctant to buy, it leads us to resort to ever more desperate techniques.

▪ Imagine for a moment you were the poor customer who got tricked into adding travel insurance to a flight. It is possible you would never notice. It is also possible that you noticed, but couldn’t be bothered to correct the problem. However, a significant proportion of people will want to get their money back.

▪ The kind of techniques becoming so prominent on the web at the moment are designed to manipulate people into doing something they do not want to do. But sooner or later the user wakes up and regrets their decision. That is the point it starts costing the business.

▪ First, the user will reach out to customer support and it costs the company money to handle that complaint. If an unhappy customer picks up the phone and calls a company it costs on average £3.50 per call10. Even if they use live chat or email, an employee needs to read and respond to these enquiries, all of which costs the company money.

▪ Forcing people to sign up to a newsletter can lead to that newsletter being blocked from legitimate subscribers’ inboxes.

▪ If someone ends up on a mailing list without granting explicit permission, it can cost a company a lot. Worst-case scenario: a company has to defend itself against a legal challenge. Even the more common response of marking your emails as spam can cost a company. Other emails from your company can be blocked by filters, effectively reducing your marketing capabilities.

▪ In short, the cost of unhappy customers can be substantial for a business. Unfortunately these costs are not always visible, especially to those instigating the use of online manipulation.

▪ The chances are that, like Acme Electronics, your company is organized into departmental silos with each silo responsible for its own areas. In that kind of organizational structure, departments focus on meeting their own targets and rarely think holistically about the whole organization.

▪ As long as e-commerce sales were going up, the head of e-commerce was happy. She wasn’t responsible for returns and so didn’t even consider the broader ramifications. She was doing her job well and that was all that mattered. Similarly, the head of the returns team was not too concerned. He was measured on how efficiently returns were processed and not the number of returns. It wasn’t his problem.

▪ But as you will discover as you read upcoming chapters, if we do not measure our conversion rate effectively, we cannot hope to know how to improve it.

▪ I am shocked at how many digital projects lack any agreed measures of success. Organizations routinely redesign websites because “they look a bit out of date” rather than with a specific measurable goal in mind. With no clear objective, how can you judge if that redesign has succeeded in increasing the conversion rate?

▪ Equally, I have seen mobile apps commissioned and maintained at considerable expense because a senior executive just decided the organization needed an app.

▪ A lack of metrics can seriously undermine any project, but it is particularly absurd for digital projects when accessing high-quality data on the deliverables is embarrassingly easy.

▪ The result of these kinds of vanity projects is that they are typically directionless. Because the people commissioning the site either don’t know what they want to achieve or are not honest about it, the site lacks clear objectives and success cannot be measured.

▪ Without a way to measure the success or otherwise of the websites we create, we have no way to prove the value of our work. That means we will struggle to justify our fees, our jobs, and further investment in the site in the future.

▪ Experience has taught me that the clients most willing to invest money into their websites are those who run e-commerce sites. They can see a direct monetary return on every dollar spent. They can see that the more money they put in, the more they get out.

▪ Many sites lack that clear relationship between investment and return. In such situations we must work with stakeholders to create that relationship by defining metrics we wish to improve and, where possible, associate a monetary value with those.

▪ Organizations typically measure success by defining a set of key performance indicators (KPIs). These are quantifiable measures used to evaluate the progress of your site over time.

▪ But deciding what these metrics are will not always be easy, especially when it means soliciting agreement from multiple stakeholders.

▪ Once you have these broad organizational goals, seek to identify ways that a high performing website could help to achieve them. That might be generating more leads, reducing support queries, or increasing the number of shares on social media.

▪ Finally, turn these criteria into something measurable. For example, generating more leads might be measured by the number of contact forms submitted, while reducing support queries might be a drop in the number of people phoning the company.

▪ Be as specific as you can realistically measure with each of these criteria. Lack of clarity often leads to disagreements internally over whether a site has been successful or not.

▪ You could argue that you have achieved your objective when more people submit an enquiry form. Surely this means you have successfully increased your site’s conversion rate? But if all those enquiry submissions are from people who do not have the budget to buy the company’s products or services, you are just creating an overhead for the sales team to respond to. Because their time is wasted following up on poor quality leads you reduce their effectiveness and the company’s overall conversion rate.

▪ The lesson here is not to become too obsessed with your metrics: they are often less than perfect. The numbers can only ever be an indicator of success, and as you will see shortly, we need a range of metrics to ensure success.

▪ Another reason to establish a range of metrics is that if we focus on the wrong measurement, it can damage the site’s overall performance. For example, focusing purely on conversion can result in annoying pop-up overlays and manipulation that will hurt long-term customer satisfaction and sales, as I mentioned in the first chapter as the dangers of persuasion. To avoid these problems, seek to have a mix of metrics that balance one another.

▪ Typically, I attempt to have a mix of three areas to ensure balance. These are:

•conversion

•usability

•engagement

▪ The most obvious metric to track is conversion rate. Ultimately, the majority of websites exist to persuade users to take some form of action. These actions often create a tangible financial benefit for the company.

▪ Whether it is downloading a PDF ebook or a piece of software, surely tracking downloads is straightforward? Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case. For a start, just because somebody downloads something doesn’t mean they do anything with it. That ebook may sit unread on a user’s file system until they eventually delete it. Equally, those who download an app often delete them after trying it for only a few minutes.

▪ Tools like UXCam1 allow you to track the usage of your downloaded app

▪ Then there is the question of who is downloading. Is your download getting into the right hands? Are you reaching the right audience? That is why marketers sometimes ask for a little bit of information from a person before they can download. Of course, this creates a usability hurdle, and a balance has to be struck.

▪ Finally, there is the question of where the users downloading have come from. We need to be able to track the referral path a user took to get to the download. For example, if most people downloading have come from a particular Facebook ad, you want to know that so you can focus your marketing budget there. But knowing the referrer doesn’t just apply to an external source like Facebook. It is also useful to understand where users who download something have been within your site. That helps you analyze whether some pages are working better than others and help you optimize accordingly.

▪ Referral sources are not the only thing to consider when users make contact. We need to think about how people are contacting you. Sure, it is easy to track users who communicate with you through a web form. But what about those who phone or email?

▪ Some websites try to qualify leads when they are submitted online. This almost always results in asking the user more questions, which ultimately reduces the conversion rate or drives people to pick up the phone instead.

▪ As I said earlier, being able to attach a monetary value to conversions makes a huge difference because it justifies investment in the website and other digital channels. That is why e-commerce sites typically see higher levels of investment.

▪ In some ways, tracking e-commerce is the easiest, but the abundance of data available also allows you to dive into much more detail than you would with other types of conversion. That can prove overwhelming. So let’s take a look at some of the website conversion metrics you could be tracking.

▪ A typical drop-off point on any e-commerce site is the shopping cart: users add items and yet never progress to purchase. It’s a useful metric to track because you can test various methods of encouraging people to buy. If you don’t track shopping cart abandonment, you cannot know whether your improvements have the desired result.

▪ To identify these problems and experiment with possible solutions it is necessary to track behavior at each step of this process.

▪ It could be that discounts for first-time buyers are boosting new user purchases, while alienating existing customers who resent not receiving those discounts. Or maybe loyal, returning customers are masking the fact that your website is inferior at attracting and converting new people.

▪ It is only possible to discover these problems and fix them if you can segment these audiences and compare their conversion rate.

▪ The time will come when your website conversion rate begins to stagnate after you have fixed the most glaring conversion issues. At this point, you can either focus on driving more traffic to the site or encouraging each person who does buy to spend more money.

▪ Admittedly, some of these figures might have to be estimated, but measuring something is better than measuring nothing.

▪ What is important to take away is the critical role metrics play in conversion rate optimization; otherwise you will have no way to know whether any changes you implement make a difference.

▪ Stop worrying about what the average is or what your competition is doing. Instead, focus on improving your own metrics over time. You will never finish — but that is the point. You can always improve, and you cannot afford to stand still.

▪ Measuring usability is often overlooked in favor of focusing on conversion. But ignoring usability as a metric can have a significant negative impact on the long-term health of your business and will discourage users taking action.

▪ Users tend to be faithful to websites they find easy to use. Such faithfulness increases a customer’s lifetime value, allowing companies to pay more for customer acquisition and so outperform competitors in pay-per-click listings.

Customers will even pay a premium for a straightforward experience: if your website is easy to use you can potentially charge more! The original Apple iPod is a classic example of this. It was overpriced and had fewer features than many of its competitors. However, it was easy to use and quickly came to dominate the market. Ease of use sells!

▪ Most organizations need a cheap, quick method of measuring usability and that is where the system usability scale2 comes in.

The System Usability Scale

The system usability scale is a simple survey that asks users to express their level of agreement with a series of statements. Participants rank each statement from one to five based on how much they agree or disagree. Five means they agree entirely, while one means they strongly disagree.

▪ The system usability scale has a standard set of statements, meaning you can easily compare your website with any other and the universal average of all user interfaces.

▪ •I think I would like to use this website frequently.

•I found the website unnecessarily complicated.

•I thought the website was easy to use.

•I think I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this website.

•I found the various functions in this website were well integrated.

•I thought there was too much inconsistency in this website.

•I would imagine that most people would learn to use this website very quickly.

•I found the website very cumbersome to use.

•I felt very confident using the website.

•I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this website.

▪ The only change I have made to the default survey is to substitute the word “website” for the typical phrasing of “system.” That makes it clear to the participant what the statements refer to.

▪ All of that mathematical gymnastics is a bit fiddly, but there are resources out there that can help you, like this Excel calculator created by Satori Interactive3. The effort in calculating a score is worth it as it gives you an easy rating out of 100 for measuring usability, a metric that allows you to track improvements over time.

▪ The average system usability score is 684 and anything above 80 means you are in a perfect place. However, anything approximately 50 or below and you need to prioritize usability fixes.

▪ The average system usability score is 68. Anything below 50 should be of concern.

▪ You can also use the system usability scale to compare your site with the competition by asking users to rank multiple sites

▪ The system usability scale can further be used to rate a prototype against an existing site or to compare multiple design approaches.

▪ Although the system usability scale is an excellent way of measuring a site’s usability and, by extension, the impact of usability on conversion, it is not perfect. The system usability scale suffers from two flaws.

▪ First, it can only identify how good or bad the usability of a website is. It cannot diagnose why it is succeeding or failing. Second, there is often a discrepancy between what a user says and reality. Somebody might describe a website as easy to use because they are familiar with it. Equally, they might say they will recommend that site to others in the moment of completing a survey, but not actually do it.

▪ We cannot only rely on the system usability scale. We also need to measure how users perform when completing critical tasks on a website

▪ We need to measure a series of factors, such as:

•the time it took the user to complete the action

•the number of users who utterly failed to complete the task

•whether the user was able to complete the call to action using the most direct route

•the average number of mistakes the user made when trying to complete the task

▪ Fortunately, these various metrics do not all have to be measured separately. We can ascertain all of them by watching real users complete tasks.

▪ However, because we are looking to gather quantitative data, testing with a more significant number of users is preferable as this reduces any one user skewing the metric with atypical behavior.

▪ Because facilitated usability testing can be time-consuming, it may be preferable to carry out unfacilitated testing when seeking to establish metrics around critical tasks such as your calls to action. In unfacilitated testing, the user is set a task to complete, and they then finish it without being directly observed or interacted with by a facilitator

▪ Many tools can help with unfacilitated testing of this nature.

▪ One option is to use an application such as Lookback6. Lookback allows you to carry out both facilitated and unfacilitated testing7 both in person and remotely

▪ One solution to this problem is to use a tool like Maze8. Maze doesn’t record videos of user sessions or allow you to see the user completing the task. It provides detailed analytics relating to what those users did, makinges it ideal for task metrics

▪ Lookback is better suited to qualitative testing where you can observe individual user behavior, rather than just read data about it

▪ We tend to focus on things we can see. If all we see are conversion numbers, then that’s where the organization will focus. The result will be the adoption of short-term techniques to improve conversion (dark patterns) at the cost of long-term success.

▪ If we start tracking usability, we not only ensure it gets the attention it deserves, but also over time we will be able to demonstrate its value. We will be able to show that if we reduce the time it takes to complete a task, there is a direct correlation with improvements in conversion.

▪ Engagement is a critical component of how likely a user is to take action on a website. The more engaged a user is with your content, the more influenced they are by it, and the more likely they are to act on it.

▪ Unfortunately, although tracking engagement makes it relatively easy to get rapid feedback, we cannot always take that data at face value.

▪ A common metric organizations measure when seeking to understand engagement is session duration. But taken alone this can prove misleading. Is a long session an indication the user is engaged, or that they have left the browser window open and gone to make a cup of tea?

▪ A low bounce rate can be a sign of good engagement, but equally it could mean a user is wandering around a website lost and confused

▪ Even mentions on social media are not always a sign of positive engagement if those mentions are critical.

▪ Let’s be realistic. There is no perfect metric, whether you measure conversion, usability, or engagement. But there are many tools in our arsenal we can use to start building up a picture of engagement

▪ One of my favorite metrics for measuring engagement is attention minutes (otherwise known as engaged time). It is similar to session duration, but only counts the time a user is actively engaging with a page.

The page has to be active (not sitting in the background somewhere) and the user has to be doing something on the page within a specified interval. That might be scrolling, clicking, or watching a video.

▪ Momently allows you to track user attention and not simply page views

▪ I rely on a tool called Momently9 to help me track the user’s attention. It enables me to identify my most engaging posts.

▪ Of course, even attention minutes are not perfect. A user could be desperately searching for relevant information, frustrated they cannot find what they want

▪ Although, according to the Nielsen Norman Group, users give up such efforts after about 10 to 20 seconds10. So as long as they remain active beyond 20 seconds, you should only capture people who are genuinely engaged.

▪ Unfortunately, not every analytics application can measure engagement using attention minutes. If you can, it is definitely worth installing one that does if you wish to track engagement

▪ That said, be careful: too many tracking scripts can start to degrade site performance, and that will negatively impact both dwell time and conversion rates.

▪ Interactions

If you cannot track attention minutes, in most cases your next best option for measuring engagement is interactions

▪ Those interactions may be:

•comments

•downloads

•shares

•clicks

•any other interaction you consider important enough to track

▪ Some of those interactions will be more valuable to you than others, so you might want to give a numerical weighting to certain ones.

▪ Next, take this numerical score and divide it by the number of unique visits. That will give you a better indication of how engaging your content is without skewing your data with fluctuations in traffic levels

▪ Imagine that over your selected period, 50 people download a PDF, 5 people use your contact form, and 80 people leave a comment. Although the number of people submitting contact forms is lower, each one is extremely valuable, so we give it a multiplier of four. That means our 5 contacts are worth 20 points. Our cumulative score across all engagement points is 150. If the website had 1,500 unique visitors over the same period, we would divide 150 by 1,500, giving us an interaction score of 0.1. We can then track how this figure fluctuates as we make changes to the site.

▪ Also interesting is interaction depth. On my blog, I can judge engagement by the number of articles a user has looked at in a single session. When users go from one post to the next, it is a good sign they are finding my content engaging.

▪ Google Analytics makes it easy to see the number of pages a user views in a session. Depending on your type of site this could be a valuable engagement metric.

▪ Frequency of Visits

One easy metric for measuring engagement is how frequently users return to your website. Visiting often is a good indicator that users find the site worthwhile

▪ There are a couple of approaches to this metric worth considering. First, you can look at how many times a user visits the site; the higher the number is, the better (usually).

▪ Although Google Analytics makes it easy to see the number of sessions per user over a given period, it is much harder to calculate the number of days between visits.

▪ Second, you can also look at the average number of days between those visits. In this case, the relevance of that data will vary. For example, if you are updating the site hourly and yet users are only returning once a month, then there may be a problem. If you update monthly then the user returning just once a month would make perfect sense.

▪ Despite being easy to track, the type of site will heavily influence the data. For example, a high frequency would be desirable for a news website. And if a website was effectively brochureware, it might be perfectly fine if people only visit once or twice; that would be enough for the site to do its job.

▪ Scroll Depth

A better metric for measuring engagement — and one I pay close attention to — is scroll depth. How far down any particular page the user scrolls is a good indication of how useful they consider the page. It tends, therefore, to be more useful in tracking engagement with a particular page rather than the site as a whole, but this makes it helpful for optimizing page design as it helps you place calls to action in the best position.

▪ Momently makes it easy to see how much of a page a user is viewing. That is useful for both measuring engagement and working out the optimal positioning of calls to action.

▪ Just recognize that like all metrics it cannot be used in isolation; people might scroll because they cannot quickly spot what they are looking for, or because they want a quick overview of the entire page.

▪ Of course, they also comment on content they dislike as well, so it is essential to track the sentiment of comments or mentions on social media, not just their numbers.

▪ Social Mention will not only track the number of mentions on social media but the sentiment too

▪ The Net Promoter Score

Finally, I could not write about measuring engagement without mentioning the net promoter score. That tried-and-tested surveying technique is ideal for ascertaining how likely somebody is to recommend a company, service, or website to another person using a simple 1–10 rating.

▪ A score of six or below typically indicates that a user is a detractor and views the site negatively. Only a score of nine or ten suggests the user is actively engaged with the website.

▪ The net promoter score is a well-established tool for measuring satisfaction and engagement.

▪ “On a scale of 0–10, how likely is it that you would recommend this website to your friends, family, or business associates?”

▪ However, even when asking the question in this way, users tend to be influenced by other factors. They might give a low score to the website because they were disappointed with the company’s customer service (which is unrelated to the site), or even because they are in a bad mood that day.

▪ Beware Measuring With Any One Metric

As you can see, no metric is perfect for measuring the overall effectiveness of a website. We need a range of metrics working together in areas such as engagement, conversion and usability to build up a complete picture of a site’s performance. Only then can we be confident that the improvements we make to our website have a positive impact.

▪ An e-commerce website will always make conversion a higher priority, using the full range of metrics I outlined relating to that area. By contrast, a content-heavy website will place a much greater emphasis on usability, as the primary task for users on these sites is to find the answers they are seeking. However, that is not to say that such a website would ignore engagement or conversion. It would just be less important.

▪ A brochureware website will likely be smaller and so would emphasize usability less, focusing instead on engagement, but also with an eye on users taking action. Because it would have less data than an e-commerce site, the focus would probably be on a simple conversion metric, like the number of contact forms completed, rather than lifetime value or average order value.

▪ The chances are you won’t get the mix right first time, and it will evolve. That is fine, but you cannot proceed without something to measure.

▪ It is so easy for us to think we know our audience when, in reality, we do not.

▪ Relatively early in my career, I ran some usability testing with an elderly audience. I had been working on the design for a while, and I thought I had a pretty good solution. After all, I had designed for this audience before, and although this was the first time testing with older people, I was confident I understood them.

When the first participant arrived, we had an initial chat and, sure enough, she was everything I expected. She was a lovely woman, widowed 15 years ago, who spent most of her day at a local bridge club and used the internet mainly to keep in touch with family on Facebook.

▪ Eventually, it came to testing my design, so we sat down in front of my iMac, and I asked her to complete a simple task to make her feel comfortable.

“I am sorry, dear,” she said before she did anything at all. “I don’t think I can do that. I use a laptop at home and so have never used a mouse before.”

▪ The whole conversation utterly threw me! Who doesn’t know how to use a mouse in the 20th century (as it was then)? She must be an anomaly. However, it turned out every single person we tested that day had never used a mouse. Not one of them! It appeared that this generation had skipped the desktop era, being given a laptop as their first computer by a family member. That had an enormous impact on how easy they found my interface to use and yet I was utterly oblivious to the fact.

▪ We need to truly understand our audience, and that means carrying out user research.

▪ I encounter many marketing and e-commerce teams relying far too heavily on intuition, rather than any real insights

▪ We all know we should research our audience, but it is shocking how few of us do it regularly. When deadlines are pressing, and budgets are razor-thin, user research is one of the first things to go. Instead, we rely on our assumptions

▪ However, in my 23 years working on the web, I have become increasingly aware of how little I understand about users and how adept they are at surprising me. My assumptions are rarely right.

▪ However, as I wrote earlier, I am a pragmatist. I know your company will not spend money on user research without a visible return.

▪ Consolidate What You Know

The chances are that your company already knows a lot about its users. The problem is that this knowledge is spread all across the organization, and there is no complete picture anywhere.

▪ Our first step is clear. We need to consolidate what the company knows in a single place. Where that place is, is up to you, but typically I use a tool like Evernote, Notion, or Google Docs — a place you can give other people easy access to that information.

▪ ￼

For a long time Mailchimp used Evernote to consolidate all they knew about their users.

▪ Where can we look for what the company already knows about users? My first stop is usually the marketing department. They have almost certainly carried out some form of user research; research that has often led to the creation of a report or set of personas that ended up in a filing cabinet somewhere. Start by getting your hands on whatever they have, but make sure you ask when it was put together. It may be that it happened some time ago and so now might not be fully accurate.

▪ Your next stop should be the customer support team. These people speak to customers every day and usually have interesting insights into their challenges and questions. It might be that they keep some record of common queries, but if not, interviewing a few members of the team will often provide valuable information, such as what common problems users contact them about.

▪ After the customer support team, I tend to speak to the sales team. Again, they have regular contact with customers and so know who they are and what they are trying to achieve. Sales teams also have the advantage of spending time visiting customers and so will have some benficial impressions about who they are.

▪ Next, it is time for you to delve into the data. Analytics can provide valuable information about user concerns. There might be some demographic details, such as location, but what we mainly care about are our users’ questions, concerns and objections.

▪ I would encourage you to take a look at what keyword phrases brought users to the site in the first place, and what they typed into your website search box. That will tell you a lot about what they are after

▪ You will also need to pay careful attention to which pages they are visiting on the site as this will give you an indication of their priorities.

▪ Finally, take a look at social media. Take time to check out the profiles of those who follow you. You will quickly build up a picture of who these people are and, if you also look at their interactions with your company, what they want.

▪ Take anything you learn and put it into your tool of choice. Don’t worry about organizing it. We will sort through it all later. For now, you are just making sure all that knowledge is in a single location.

▪ Once you have completed that process, it is time to start sorting through what you have. Some information will be horribly out of date; other information will be irrelevant. In short, you will have to sort through rubbish to find the gems

▪ And before you can do that, you need to know what those gems are. What is it about your users you need to understand?

▪ In my experience, most of the research into target audiences within organizations has a marketing slant to it. For example, if you look at the average persona, they tend to focus on demographic information and personal tastes

▪ Don’t get me wrong; this is valuable information. To appeal to a person, you need to understand their values and attitudes. But it is not the whole story, especially when it comes to online conversion.

▪ However, if a user arrives on your website, they have already given you their attention. It may be just for a few seconds, but by visiting your site, they are at least interested in what you have to offer in principle.

▪ The User’s Questions

Most users come to a site to find answers to their questions. Those could be as broad as “Does this company provide the services I need?” to specific questions around how your offering works. If we do not know those questions, the website will not meet their needs and will not persuade them.

▪ The User’s Objections

Many of the questions the user has are concerns or objections. They are reasons why they might be hesitant to take action. We need to know these objections so we can address them.

▪ Again, the website doesn’t exist in isolation. Users interact with a company in many different ways. They use online channels like social media, as well as offline, such as a call centre. Understanding where the website fits into these interactions is essential.

▪ To achieve their goal, users normally need to complete a series of tasks on your website. That might be buying something, or contacting the company. A good website has to support these tasks, and so we must be clear about what they are.

▪ The Pain Points the User Needs Help Overcoming

Often the user’s goal is to address a problem. This pain point has driven them to look for a solution, and they want to know whether your company can provide it.

▪ Only yesterday, I was on a call discussing how I could help map the customer journey for a potential client. They made it clear that they had done all of the necessary research; they just needed my help collating that research and turning it into a visualization of the journey.

▪ Although this was all valuable information, it didn’t prove particularly helpful when mapping most aspects of the customer journey. It gave me no insights into how the user was feeling, what questions they had, what tasks they needed to complete, or what pain points they were trying to overcome.

▪ Right now, however, I want to focus on just two: surveys and interviews. These two techniques are both handy for uncovering the kinds of information we require and are inexpensive to run.

▪ What is more, the questions most organizations ask in their surveys are not always the most fruitful for increasing conversion. If we are trying to improve conversion, we need focused surveys that help us understand one simple thing: why people are not acting.

▪ As part of this process, I wanted to know why some people chose not to enrol, so I asked them. I ran a simple survey when people went to exit the site without buying that asked a single question:

If you decided not to act today, could you let us know why?

▪ First, it is short! When you limit the survey to a single question, your response rate skyrockets

▪ Never collect information simply because it might prove useful. Only ask a question if you know exactly how you are going to make use of the answers.

▪ If you ask questions that allow the user to type whatever they want, you have to spend hours looking at the responses afterwards to identify trends. By restricting things to multiple-choice answers, you can see patterns at a glance. Not only that, but a multiple-choice question requires less thought from the user and so also improves your response rate.

▪ Too many businesses create surveys with no clear picture as to how they are going to use the answers. By asking such a direct question, it is obvious how to take the answer and apply it to make improvements.

▪ Notice how the survey doesn’t ask for any personal details. People don’t like sharing information about themselves and if you do ask, then expect far fewer people to respond. People are reluctant enough without making it look like a covert attempt to get personal data for marketing purposes.

▪ Finally, if the response rate is low, you might consider offering an incentive. Although that could be a material or monetary reward, it doesn’t have to be if budgets are tight. A digital download is often a good incentive because you can offer it at no additional cost to everybody who completes the survey. Another alternative is entry into a prize draw — anything to thank people for the time they are taking to complete the survey.

▪ If you do run a survey with several questions, remember that the more you add, the lower the completion rate. Make sure you only ask questions whose answers you are sure how you’ll use.

▪ However, there is value in surveying existing customers. One question I like to ask is, “What was the one thing that nearly stopped you buying?” After all, if it nearly stopped them, then it is probably stopping other people.

▪ As you can see, surveys are a powerful way of gaining insights into barriers to conversion. But surveys are not enough without the support of user interviews.

▪ Reading facts is not the same as lived experience, and that is why you need to meet with your audience in person. Only if you spend time with people can you understand them; and only once you understand them can you seek to encourage them to act. Running a survey is not enough.

▪ The UK’s Government Digital Service values user research so highly it insists that project stakeholders must have at least two hours of contact with users within the last six weeks to participate.

▪ So how should you start? Well, although it will take a little more effort, I would recommend visiting your audience in their place of work or at their home. I can tell you from personal experience: this kind of interview is transformative.

▪ The first time I did this, I was working on an e-commerce website. The client insisted I spent some time with their audience personally, but I admit I was skeptical, thinking that I had carried out more than enough research

▪ First, we look at our websites, and they seem simple and easy for us; but in the real world, people are distracted and in less than optimal conditions. We cannot assume we have people’s full attention.

▪ I would never have learned those lessons from a survey or a report, or even speaking to her over the phone or at my office. It was only visiting her home that meant I saw the real person behind the personas and research.

▪ A simple phone call is a perfectly valid way of carrying out a remote interview. Personally, I favor videoconferencing using something like Skype or Zoom.

▪ A tool like Zoom or Skype will allow you to see the person and their screen during interviews.

▪ Although sometimes a little unreliable compared with the phone, videoconferencing does offer two distinct advantages. First, you can share screens, allowing you to look at things together

▪ Second (and in my opinion even more importantly), you can see the other person. It is amazing how often facial expressions provide as many insights into the user and their thought process than what they actually say

▪ There are specialist user research videoconferencing tools, like Lookback, but being designed for usability testing, they are overkill for a simple interview. They are more designed for usability testing.

▪ Whether you intend to carry out your user research in person or remotely, I highly recommend that you carry out these interviews on a one-to-one basis, rather than running group sessions

▪ Although focus groups have been popular for many years, they do come with some significant flaws that could lead you to false conclusions. In focus groups, you tend to find that more extrovert characters dominate the conversation and carry the rest of the group with them.

▪ One-to-one interviews may take longer, but they will give you much more fruitful insights into your audience.

▪ Whatever approach you adopt, the key to success is going into these interviews with a clear picture of what it is that you wish to learn

▪ Discussing their journey is a good starting point for two reasons. First, it focuses on their experience and not their opinions. It is common for people to say one thing and do another, so concentrating on their journey means they are recounting their story, not getting drawn into a subjective discussion.

▪ One of the biggest misunderstandings about conversion optimization is the idea that a conversion is a singular event. People are often under the impression that there is a magical moment when users take action and conversion happens. In truth, the conversion is a series of smaller actions that lead users towards a final purchase.

▪ My experience with InVision is a perfect example of this.

My journey began when a fellow designer shared a post from the InVision blog. InVision regularly posts content of value aimed at its target audience. My first action was simply to click on that link and read the post.

￼

InVision has built a sales funnel around providing value to its audience, often free of charge.

I didn’t progress any further on that first visit, but later somebody else shared another InVision blog post and this time I decided to sign up to its newsletter. That was my second action.

Most of the time I was too busy to read the emails InVision sent me, despite them containing more valuable content. However, one email caught my eye because it included a link to a wireframe template that worked with Sketch (my graphics package of choice). This would save me considerable time, so I was quick to download it, completing another action that continued my engagement with InVision.

By this stage, I was seriously impressed by InVision and actively interested in what it had to offer. I was aware of its main product at this point, but I was still reluctant to commit to yet another monthly fee. I spotted Invision’s free plugin for Sketch (called Craft) that added some much needed missing functionality. Another step on my journey: I downloaded it.

￼

InVision inserted itself into my daily life with the Craft plugin. Suddenly InVision was an essential part of my workflow.

I hadn’t used the plugin for long before I needed to show a client a prototype I was designing. I noticed the plugin allowed me to upload my prototype straight to InVision from within Sketch. I took my next step there and then, opening a free account and uploading my prototype to InVision.

I quickly became hooked and found that InVision became a part of my design workflow. When I started to hit the limitations of the free account with InVision, the next step was to sign up for a paid account. It was the most natural and obvious action. I have never looked back.

Note all the smaller actions I took that led me to become a loyal customer of InVision:

▪ •Reading multiple blog posts.

•Signing up for the newsletter.

•Downloading the free wireframe template.

•Installing the Craft plugin.

•Opening a free account.

•Starting to pay a monthly fee.

▪ Like many people, I suffer from subscription fatigue. It seems like every piece of software wants to extract a monthly fee, and it has led me to resist. How did InVision overcome that resistance, so that by today I must have paid thousands of dollars for its service?

The answer lies in the sales funnel, a tried-and-tested approach used in sales and marketing for years. The premise of a sales funnel is straightforward. Instead of asking people to make a substantial commitment on day one, you suggest progressively larger commitments over time. Eventually that culminates in the “big ask.” In other words, a sales funnel takes the user on a journey, one no-brainer decision at a time.

▪ There is also another interesting thing to notice about sales funnels. They make a compelling case to avoid dark patterns.

▪ To demonstrate this point, let’s look at an example that is a striking contrast to InVision’s approach.

It begins with a confession: I am not good at buying gifts. I hate coming up with presents, and I regularly make terrible choices. One such time was when I considered buying a subscription to Good Housekeeping magazine for my mum. Yes, I know. It’s a terrible gift idea, but I was desperate.

I was searching for present ideas and came across a post suggesting some things I might consider. It turns out the article was on the Good Housekeeping website, and unsurprisingly it suggested a subscription to the magazine.

So, already we have the beginning of a sales funnel.

•I recognized a need to buy a present.

•I started to research my options.

•I identified a possible gift.

Unfortunately, that is where things went wrong. I didn’t even get as far as visiting the subscription page, let alone subscribing. The problem was that within seconds of viewing the article, a pop-up overlay appeared trying to persuade me to sign up for their newsletter.

￼

Good Housekeeping alienated me as a user and stopped me progressing down its sales funnel.

The call to action offered me two options:

•Show me the best cleaning tips.

•No thanks, that soap scum isn’t bothering me.

They tried to shame me into signing up to their newsletter. That one action completely undermined any trust Good Housekeeping had built by providing me free advice and alienated me. I didn’t sign up to the newsletter, and I certainly didn’t subscribe to the magazine. Their entire sales funnel fell apart, because of one bad link in the chain. That said, my mum had a narrow escape! Dark patterns alienate users and discourage them from progressing on their journey. By eroding trust, you undermine the sales funnel, which ultimately damages conversion.

▪ However, from a conversion rate optimization perspective, customer journey mapping provides another benefit too. It helps you develop a customer-centric sales funnel. A sales funnel built around delivering value to the customer, rather than forcing them down a fictional sales pipeline.

▪ This is the difference between InVision, who took the time to understand how they could provide value for me while still moving me towards subscribing; and Good Housekeeping, who attempted to force me to complete the next step of signing up to their newsletter.

▪ I see a lot of people get themselves into a mess when they try to map the customer journey. They try to make it an accurate representation of the user experience. Unfortunately, that is not possible. The real world is messy, and no two users’ experiences will be the same. Also, those journeys are rarely linear, with people moving back and forth between different kinds of interactions.

▪ Take my clients. Like you, they might start reading this book after seeing it on my site. But that doesn’t guarantee they will neatly progress to the next step of hiring me. They may well return to my website and read other posts, sign up for my newsletter, and then be inspired to investigate yet more of my content. That might go on for some time before they switch to the podcast. Real life is messy!

▪ Unlike a customer journey map, a persona doesn’t show how the user’s experience changes over time.

▪ It is an archetype that represents the underlying complexity of the real experience but in a more digestible form. In other words, a customer journey map is not going to be 100% accurate.

▪ A typical website might only act as a marketing tool. It creates desire in the user for the product and answers fundamental questions, but the action of buying might happen offline. However, the same website might enable the user to place an order and even get after-sales support.

▪ If you know how much of the journey the project covers, it will help define the scope and the appropriate calls to action. So if we know that the actual sale happens offline, then we understand that the role of the website is to inspire people to make contact with the company. We don’t have to answer every objection the user has, just enough to encourage them to reach out. The offline sales team will do the rest

▪ By contrast, if the sale happens online, we need to address every objection that might be preventing people from buying. The goal here is to make it so users never need to contact the company.

▪ Finally, customer journey mapping can be a helpful tool in broader digital transformation because, at its heart, digital transformation is about adapting to changing consumer expectations

▪ Earlier, I talked about Samaritans and how their customer journey mapping identified a problem in how they dealt with people in need of their help. By mapping the customer journey, we uncovered a change in consumer behavior. Increasingly, people didn’t want to contact the charity by phone; they wanted to use digital channels. That helped define a program of organizational change to address this difference in people’s behavior. Customer journey mapping helps to expose these changes in customer behavior. It ensures organizations don’t base planning on assumptions.

▪ How to Create a Customer Journey Map

You can set up the basics of a customer journey map in a three- to four-hour workshop, once you have all the user research we talked about in chapter 3 in place.

▪ But be careful. If you don’t have customers in the workshop, it will be essential to test anything produced to ensure it is accurate. That can be as simple as showing the results of the session to customers and asking their thoughts.

▪ However, try to limit the number of steps to about five.

▪ More importantly, the more steps you add, the more complex the journey will be, and the final journey map will be too confusing — people will ignore it. The aim is to create a simple, compelling story you can refer to when making decisions, writing copy, and creating calls to action.

▪ You now have a decision to make: you can either map the entire journey at a relatively superficial level, or set out part of the experience in more detail.

▪ However, if you are looking to create an entire sales funnel, then your customer journey map should cover the whole user experience.

▪ Notice how the journey map doesn’t stop at the point of conversion (placing an order). That is important, even if you are thinking in terms of building your sales funnel. We want to develop a sustainable conversion strategy.

▪ That means we need to ensure our customers have a pleasant experience even after making a purchase. If we don’t, we will not receive repeat orders. Repeat orders are incredibly valuable as they often come with a low cost of sale. By comparison, winning new customers is always an expensive business. According to Alan E. Webber of Forrester Research2, acquiring a new customer costs five times more than retaining a current one.

▪ Whatever your approach, don’t overthink it. If there is disagreement, consider voting to break the stalemate. Momentum is important. You can always revise your stages later.

▪ These elements are mostly the same information we talked about gathering in chapter 3:

•what questions the user has at that point in their journey

•any objections preventing them from progressing

•any tasks they need to complete at that point

•any people, organizations or sites that may be influencing their thinking

•how they are feeling at that point in the journey

•any points of interaction they have with the company

▪ In essence, you end up with a grid. The steps run horizontally across the table as columns. The categories listed above then run down the side as rows. I find it best to draw this grid on a massive sheet of paper covering one wall of the workshop room.

▪ Now it is merely a matter of filling in the boxes. For example, what questions do users have when they are researching products?

▪ I often find it speeds things up considerably if you break the workshop down into smaller groups, and each group takes one of the stages to review

▪ You will find that you generate a considerable number of questions, tasks, and so on for each stage. It is impossible to include all of these on the final map without completely overwhelming anybody trying to understand it. To address this problem, and also allow the groups to validate each other’s work, I recommend you end the workshop with a validation and voting exercise

▪ Encourage participants to look at each box in the grid and check there isn’t anything missing. If there is, add a new sticky note

▪ At the same time, they can vote for the elements in the box that they consider the most important to users by adding a mark next to each item they consider particularly important. Each person gets three votes per box.

▪ They can either spend all three votes on a single Post-it, because they consider it very important, or spread those votes across several elements.

▪ After the workshop, take the wall grid and boil it down into an infographic that everybody can easily refer to throughout projects and planning sessions. I recommend getting a designer to do this for you, as condensing the data in an easy to read way is quite tricky.

▪ One thing a customer journey map does not cover is overall goals and pain points; in other words, what the user is trying to achieve and how they are hoping your organization can help.

▪ The reason a customer journey map doesn’t usually show this is because these two areas don’t change. The user’s ultimate goal and the pain points they are hoping you will alleviate are the same wherever the user is on their journey.

▪ Do not try and design a sales funnel unless you are confident about what the user is trying to achieve.

▪ Often the ultimate goal or pain point is not as apparent as it might first appear. For example, a B2B customer might tell you that their goal is to improve some business metric. That may be true to an extent, but it is probably not the whole story. Chances are there is an underlying personal motivation such as securing a promotion, getting a pay rise, or a fear of being fired.

▪ It is always worth seeking out these selfish motivations because they can be a significant influence on the decision to act, even when making a business decision.

▪ There are two points to note here. First, not all touchpoints are digital. We also want to include other interactions, including the likes of in-store visits, sales meetings, or phone calls.

▪ Second, one point of interaction might play a role at multiple stages of the journey. A company’s website is one of the best examples of this. It can be a marketing tool, e-commerce store and provide customer support. It can even be the product itself.

▪ If a channel supports multiple stages in the customer journey, this can be shown on your journey map

▪ Remember that we aim to develop a series of smaller calls to action. These are actions designed to move the user towards the point of purchase, opportunities for us to prove we are to be trusted when a more significant commitment is required.

▪ These smaller calls to action are also an opportunity to build engagement with your users and establish a relationship. Even getting a user to share your content with others is the beginning of a connection. It says that the user values what you put out into the world.

▪ There is a nearly infinite number of calls to action you might want to consider for each step of the journey. However, just a few I have used on my site include:

•share my content on social media

•sign up for my newsletter

•view a video

•download an ebook or report

•attend a webinar

•sign up for a course

•buy one of my books

•send me an email

•book a meeting

•view my services

•listen to my podcast

•pick up the phone

•post a comment on social media

▪ You get the idea, and as you can see, there are so many micro-interactions you can use to start the engagement between you and a user.

▪ Take your time to consider which call to action will be most appropriate to which stage of the journey. Asking people to book a meeting when they are only at an initial research phase doesn’t make a lot of sense. Timing is everything, and it is essential to pick the right moment.

▪ As a case in point, I once visited a site that sold T-shirts. On arriving at the website, it immediately presented me with a call-to-action overlay asking me to sign up for their newsletter. In return, the call to action told me, I could have 10% off my first order. Unsurprisingly I immediately closed the overlay. After all, I hadn’t even seen any T-shirts. How did I know I wanted 10% off?

▪ But unfortunately, it got worse. I continued to browse the site and found that, sure enough, they had many T-shirts I liked the look of. Now I was ready for my 10% off. However, I had closed the overlay and so had no way of getting it. The result of this error in timing was that all the T-shirts looked overpriced. I should be getting them 10% cheaper than that. In the end, I abandoned the site frustrated by the whole experience.

▪ The question you must ask as you look at your calls to action for each stage of the journey is whether it is an appropriate action for where the user is at the time

▪ Timing can make an enormous difference, as I discovered for myself on my site. Like most bloggers, I am keen to attract more newsletter sign-ups, and so I placed my call to action high on the page for visitors to see it as soon as they arrived on my site. That worked to some extent, but I was disappointed with the results.

In desperation, I tried an overlay that displayed as soon as people hit the site. It helped a little but also caused a spike in my bounce rate as people abandoned the site because of the annoying overlay. Then I tried moving the newsletter sign-up form to the bottom of each blog post. I hoped that once people had a chance to see my content, they would be more receptive to signing up. Sure enough, it worked. People needed to see that my content was of value before they were willing to sign up to my newsletter.

▪ That said, getting the timing right and showing you can deliver value isn’t enough to deliver business results. A call to action also has to move the user down the sales funnel. That means you need to be clear about the role any particular call to action has.

▪ The role of any particular call to action may seem obvious. After all, a call to action to sign up for a newsletter is trying to gather newsletter subscriptions! But that isn’t the whole story. You need to ask yourself why you want those newsletter sign-ups and how that moves the user down the sales funnel.

▪ Micro-interactions might include actions such as:

•visiting a landing page

•reading a post

•sharing on social media

•following you on social media

•signing up for a newsletter

•viewing a related article

•attending a webinar

•downloading a fact sheet

•ordering a sample

•signing up for a free trial

▪ Knowing when each of these calls to action should happen is important for two reasons. First, as we have already established, it will help pick your moment to ask people to complete the call to action. That will shape where and how you display your call to action. Second, it will help shape the messaging that goes with the call to action. We can look at the questions, tasks, feelings, and objections the user faces at that point in the journey and tailor our messaging to address those.

▪ McDonald’s has not been afraid to address customer concerns

▪ We will explore messaging surrounding calls to action in later chapters. For now, it is only necessary to note that you should directly connect this messaging to where the user is in their journey and, by extension, the sales funnel

▪ Your sales funnel is like a leaky pipe. Users flow into the top and then slowly dribble out through holes before a small number reach the end. To some extent, this is inevitable. You are not going to convert 100% of people who enter your funnel. However, we do want to patch as many leaks as possible. To do that we need to know where the pipe is leaking.

▪ Let’s look at a sales funnel for selling an online course:

•Making the customer aware of your course

•Encouraging their interest

•Helping them evaluate the course

•Creating a desire to take the course

•Encourage enrolment

▪ Various touchpoints will support each of those stages:

•Awareness: pay-per-click advertising

•Interest: landing page

•Evaluate: course details

•Desire: course sample

•Enrolment: checkout

▪ Now we can map calls to action against each of those to track where people are potentially dropping out of our sales funnel:

•Click pay-per-click ad

•Click through to view course details

•Request a course sample

•Begin the checkout process

•Complete checkout process

▪ You may remember in chapter 2 when we discussed metrics; I talked about the need to monitor quality as well as quantity. That is just as applicable here. If you don’t have the right kind of people completing a call to action, then they will inevitably drop out at some point in the funnel.

▪ I have been privileged to work with some very prestigious businesses from an enormous range of sectors. I have worked with multinationals, global e-commerce businesses, and international charities. And despite working with supposedly world-class organizations, I am continually surprised at just how little thinking goes into most of their projects, especially around the area of conversion optimization.

▪ Most attempts to improve conversion seem to begin with somebody in senior management, having a bright idea about something which might make things better. They rarely base this on anything other than a hunch and their experience.

▪ When these companies turn those ideas into projects, they aren’t prioritized by the potential return on investment or their ability to improve conversion. No, they are prioritized by urgency or how senior their sponsor is. As for the projects themselves, they are based on the executive vision and around internal politics.

▪ Remember I mentioned that a sales funnel is like a leaking pipe? Well, your sales funnel, customer journey map, and associated metrics are excellent tools for identifying where those leaks are occurring. By assessing these, you will see the weak points where you are losing users or providing them with an inferior experience.

▪ For instance, I once worked with a charity that invested heavily in TV advertising every year, only to drive potential donors to a massively under-performing website. They prioritized TV advertising because a vocal and opinionated stakeholder championed it.

▪ Any digital project involves hundreds of decisions, both during the definition phase and development. Often these decisions are based on nothing more than experience and intuition. These both have their place, but they come with danger — it is easy to lose sight of the user.

▪ A relentless focus on what the user wants and needs is crucial to improve your conversion rate successfully, and your customer journey map can provide that.

▪ When a user sees a newsletter sign-up form they are quick to think of reasons not to subscribe.

▪ Take even the simplest of actions: signing up for a newsletter. Together, your fearful primal brain and your cynical system can come up with no shortage of reasons why you shouldn’t sign up.

▪ •What if they sell my email address to a third party?

•What if the content is rubbish?

•What if they make it hard to unsubscribe?

•What if they send me too many emails?

•What if they pressure me into buying?

•What if they get hacked?

▪ We never seem to have a shortage of what-if scenarios for even the most trivial of decisions.

▪ By far the best way of understanding the risks users have is to ask them. Yes, I am aware this sounds blindingly obvious, but have you done it? I am continually surprised by how few people do.

▪ You could even use a social voting tool like Tricider1 to allow users to submit concerns and vote for suggestions others have made.

▪ That said, there is no shortage of common risks that are relatively generic. Depending on the audience, the intensity with which they will feel these risks will vary. However, the same concerns raise their heads again and again — concerns like those around privacy.

▪ Worries About Privacy

An increasing number of people are worried about their data and irritated by companies that share it with third parties. That is especially true in light of the exposure GDPR legislation has brought to the issue.

▪ Some compliance rules do nothing but increase worries, such as intimidating terms and conditions that nobody has the time to read, but they know they should. Also, don’t even get me started on cookie notifications, which are a significant usability hurdle.

▪ Whatever the case, it is crucial to consider privacy as a conversion issue and not just one of compliance

▪ Privacy pages typically do little to reassure users about how their data will be used.

▪ “We will never share your personal information with anybody” or “We only use your data to identify you when you log in.” Of course, to write a line like that it has to be accurate, and many companies are terrible at actually respecting people’s personal data. That flags a more significant issue about how organizational policy has as much of an impact on conversion as the design or the interface, or how compelling the copy is.

▪ Users worry that their data might be breached, such as when Ashley Madison was hacked, exposing the email addresses of thousands of people seeking affairs to the public. And although people are worried about their email addresses being stolen, they are more concerned about their financial data, like credit card numbers.

▪ The number of scare stories and urban legends around credit card fraud (as well as real occurrences) have made many people paranoid about purchasing online. We need to take every opportunity to address this concern if we need people to part with sensitive financial data.

▪ Yes, our websites need to be secure, but from a conversion perspective, it is equally essential that we communicate the fact that our sites are safe to users. We cannot assume that users understand that a padlock in the address bar shows a site is secure, or that they will know that a Verisign logo or a message about 128-bit encryption are good things. We need to communicate clearly in language the user can understand.

▪ Of course, it is not just criminals getting their hands on personal data that concerns people. They are also worried about what you might do with that data.

▪ I bet you like to moan about spam. We all enjoy grumbling about it, and we all hate receiving it.

▪ However, spam is in the eye of the beholder, and what you think and what your users think can be very different things. Notifications, updates, and special offers can — if sent too often — drive users crazy.

▪ When asking a user to share their email address, we should explain how we are going to use it, and how often they can expect to hear from us.

▪ “Every two weeks you will receive support improving your site by creating a better user experience and a more effective digital strategy. You can unsubscribe in one click, and I will never share your email address.”

▪ In those two sentences I address four concerns:

•How often subscribers will receive emails.

•What those emails cover and, by extension, their usefulness.

•What I will do with their email address.

•Whether it is easy to unsubscribe.

▪ The point about unsubscribing is particularly important as this relates to another concern front-and-center in users’ minds — how committed will they be to this decision?

▪ Every call to action requires some commitment from the user. That might be something as simple as being associated with the content they have just shared, to something huge like a contract committing them to spend millions with a supplier.

▪ As a result, one of the concerns users have is just how big a commitment they’re making. The bigger the commitment, the harder we have to work to reassure the user. With something like newsletter sign-up, that means giving them a straightforward method of unsubscribing. With something more significant like an e-commerce purchase, it might be a good returns policy.

▪ By offering an excellent returns policy, IKEA addresses users’ concerns about buying the wrong thing.

▪ In short, wherever possible make it easy for the user to undo any commitment. They rarely will, but they like to know they can if they want.

▪ I am beginning to notice a trend when I carry out surveys and test e-commerce sites with users. I increasingly find that people will ask about delivery cost up front. They have learned that e-commerce sites hide this information and so actively look for it. Based on my observations, when it is not there, they become suspicious.

▪ Sites like ProFlowers, that hides the delivery cost until the end of the checkout process, make users worried about hidden delivery charges.

▪ However, delivery charges are not the only nasty surprises we hit users with. Forms are another excellent example. We often place uncomfortable fields later. For instance, if we need people to approve terms and conditions that we know they won’t like, we typically put these at the end of the process.

▪ In truth, these kinds of techniques will work. People will often swallow a surprise at this late stage because of something called “sunk costs.”

▪ Just because it works, however, doesn’t mean it is wise, as we discussed in chapter 1 on dark patterns. You are just creating problems for the business further down the line.

▪ We are reluctant to call customer support because we know we will spend time on hold. We put off long application processes such as getting insurance or applying for a loan because we know it will take too long

▪ According to research collated by LoadStorm2, a 1-second delay in load time leads to a 7% drop in conversion and 11% fewer page views

▪ A staggering 1 in 4 people will abandon a page that takes longer than 4 seconds to load

▪ longer than 4 seconds to load. What is more, things are even worse on mobile, with 74% of users giving up if a page takes 5 seconds or more to load

▪ Waste users’ time at your peril. If you want to maximize conversion, you must prove to users that you see their time as precious

▪ I have been working on the web for a long time. In fact, I remember the early days of e-commerce. One big debate in those days was what users would be willing to buy online. Amazon had proved that people would buy books, but some things seemed impossible to sell without consumers getting to see and try the product in person. One example of this was shoes. Received wisdom was that consumers wanted to try shoes on to make sure they were comfortable and see them for themselves. People wouldn’t be willing to risk ending up with a pair of shoes that didn’t fit or weren’t what they expected.

▪ Of course, today we know very well that you can sell shoes online. But that’s not to say our assessment of what people wanted back then was wrong. People definitely do want to try shoes on and see them for themselves. But they are willing to buy shoes online now because retailers have removed the risk of a customer ending up with a pair of shoes they do not like. The solution was to offer an exceptional returns policy.

▪ Returning products wasn’t new, of course; consumers have always been able to do that. What was different was that retailers removed the cost associated with that return. There was a time when consumers would have to pay return postage. Today, retailers are swallowing the cost of that.

▪ However, the cost to users is not just about money. It is also about time and effort, as I explained earlier. Returning items can be a hassle, and many consumers are reluctant to make the effort involved.

▪ Retailers are well aware of this and are increasingly removing this risk too. Some provide prepaid return bags with orders so the customer doesn’t have to worry about packing. Others even offer courier collection, so there’s no need to post the product back.

▪ Zappos’ success was largely due to its willingness to take on the risks that normally remained with the customer.

▪ That said, persuading colleagues to agree to these changes can be more challenging, whether big or small. I have worked with marketing teams who insist on gathering all kinds of unnecessary information. That is where measuring becomes so vital. You need to be able to prove that the risk you want to remove is hurting conversion

▪ You need to start by quantifying the cost of the risk to the business by running a test. Most of the time, this involves removing the risk for a proportion of your visitors, or for a limited time, and seeing what impact that has on conversion.

▪ For instance, what happens to conversion if you offer users prepaid returns for a set period? Alternatively, would the number of people contacting you increase if you didn’t force a subset of your users to register when viewing your product demo? This kind of A/B testing should be an ongoing part of our processes

▪ We should always be experimenting with the impact of removing or addressing risk.

▪ You will find colleagues a lot more open to trying new approaches on a limited basis and much more likely to be convinced by the results of those tests than by your opinions.

▪ Unfortunately, we cannot remove all risks and even if we could, it doesn’t stop users believing there is a risk. That is why it is so important to address these risks and associated objections.

▪ I shared some examples of how you can address the user’s perceived risks when I talked about newsletter sign-up, privacy, and security

▪ Let’s begin by addressing the biggest mistake I see companies make — pretending the risk doesn’t exist.

▪ Do Not Avoid Mentioning Risks

You could argue that drawing attention to potential risks could plant those risks in people’s minds and, by extension, reduce conversion

▪ People are savvier than we give them credit for

▪ Also, there are many risks, such as the ones I have discussed in this chapter, that are near-universal.

▪ The vast majority of people will worry about privacy, security, spam, and making a mistake, because our culture or psychology has baked them into our thinking.

▪ Every negative comment is just a click away, and so we are forced to address anything a user might consider a risk.

▪ Let’s be honest: we have all heard the rumors about McDonald’s. Stories that suggest chicken nuggets contain bits of the bird most of us would prefer not to eat, or that the fries don’t contain actual potato. These are certainly not the kind of objections you would want to advertise. Yet McDonald’s doesn’t ignore them.

▪ McDonald’s is not afraid to confront the questions people have about its products.

▪ “Are Chicken McNuggets® made with real chicken?”

The reply is equally direct:

“Chicken breast meat is the only meat we use across our entire chicken range, including our McNuggets®.”

▪ Notice that McDonald’s doesn’t repeat the rumors about the product. They address the objection without explicitly citing it.

▪ That said, too often companies force users to hunt for the reassurance they crave.

▪ Another way of ascertaining this would be by using top task analysis. Top task analysis is a technique created by usability expert Gerry McGovern3 to ascertain what tasks users most want to complete on a website, tasks that can include getting answers to their objections.

▪ A top task analysis is a survey that asks users to prioritize their top tasks from a long list of potential tasks. The user is asked to give five to their most important task, four to the next, down to one. All the rest of the tasks are left blank.

▪ What is interesting about top task analysis is that almost always a small number of tasks dominate users’ thinking. Not all concerns users have are equal. Some weigh more heavily on their minds than others.

▪ Establishing what these top objections are is crucial to improving conversion

▪ You may want to segment your results by the audience as well. Not all users are of equal value to a business, and different audiences will potentially have various concerns

▪ You would think that a statement like, “Not all users are of equal value to a business” would be something we could take for granted. In my experience, however, organizations are often reluctant to prioritize one audience over another. It will create all kinds of issues when attempting to optimize your conversion rate, not least the different audiences’ competing concerns.

▪ When it comes to conversion, we need to design for somebody specific. It is not enough to try to create a universal design that pleases everybody: you will please nobody

▪ That is not to say you should ignore secondary audiences. It is just that the more focused you are, the more compelling your offering will be.

▪ An excellent example of this was the work I did with UK National Air Traffic Control Services. When I worked on their website, we discovered by far their biggest audience was plane spotters. However, although they made up the majority of users, they were not an audience that provided any real value to the organization.

▪ Although plane spotters are the largest single group visiting the NATS website, they are not the audience the company focuses on.

▪ How do we address this problem? The answer lies in closely connecting any objection handling with the action a user has to take. If a user is asked to provide personal details like an email address, we need to provide reassurance right there on the same page. That doesn’t mean we have to provide our entire privacy policy, but we do need to say something to reassure users about the risk, and provide a link to more details for those particularly concerned.

▪ Closely associating reassurances regarding privacy with a newsletter sign-up form often increases conversion.

▪ That is in part because users will be less likely to see messaging elsewhere, but it can also be because the user may not think of the objection until they see the email form field. If the user is reassured before they have considered the risk, it might not remain in the front of their mind when they face the email field.

▪ Unfortunately, we cannot address all objections as easily. Most transactions will involve a degree of risk to both parties. Where there is a risk we cannot remove or address, we need to make it a risk worth taking.

▪ Some research has shown that people feel loss approximately twice as intensely as gain4. That means we have to work hard to convince people that it is worth giving up whatever it is we need them to sacrifice.

▪ According to loss aversion theory, we feel the loss of money less than some other things because we always intended to use it for transactions. Money is a placeholder for something we want to buy. We do not value it in its own right. We appreciate it for what it can get us. Time, on the other hand, is precious to us in its own right. We don’t see it as a tradeable commodity. The same is true for our privacy or our security.

▪ Focus on Benefits Before Features

If I ask you to sign up for my newsletter, you will immediately start focusing on the potential negatives. However, if I offered you an opportunity to improve your website by receiving advice on optimizing it, your mind perceives the offer differently.

▪ That is rule one of marketing — focus on the benefits your product provides to the buyer, before talking about its features.

▪ People need to be able to see how the benefits of taking the risk will reward them personally. That applies whether talking about B2B or pretty much any product. We need to look deeper when considering somebody’s motivations and goals.

▪ However, people often have multilayered goals and knowing them all is beneficial for encouraging people to overcome their objections.

▪ Charitable giving is another example of multiple levels of motivation. Yes, people who give want to help others, and the benefits it provides to recipients will sway donors, but that is not the only motivation. People donate because they feel an obligation, or because they want to be seen as generous. Some donate for social standing, and others to belong to a specific social group. These are selfish motivations, but that doesn’t mean givers do not want to help others too.

▪ My point is that if you want people to overcome their objections and take action, you need to provide them with as personal and specific a benefit as you can. That will make it evident that any risk involved is worth taking.

▪ That might be something small like telling people how often they will receive emails if they sign up to a newsletter, or something big like the process involved in buying a house. Information is power in the minds of nervous users.

▪ When I talked about return policies, I wrote about the power of changing one’s mind. However, it is worth stating again, as it is a powerful tool in making risk more palatable by giving the user a sense of control.

▪ If I know I can unsubscribe from a newsletter easily, I am more willing to sign up. If I can downgrade my cellular tariff in a click, I am more likely to try a higher one. If I have an early breakpoint in a contract with a supplier, I am going to be more comfortable making that commitment

▪ That is still a lesson most organizations have yet to learn. They want to tie in consumers, and so consumers are reluctant to try their products. The tighter the grip on customers, the greater the desire to be free.

▪ With that in mind, we should avoid making unsubscribing or downgrading difficult. We should make it easy to opt out or undo online actions, and thereby reduce the perception of risk. And this lets us do something far more critical: start to build trust with our audience.

▪ Unfortunately, I believe that increasingly users are not approaching our websites with an open mind. Instead they come to our sites with a natural skepticism, born out of numerous bad online experiences.

▪ These observations on my part seem to be supported by others. According to HubSpot research1, only 3% of people trust salespeople and marketers, while as far back as 1999, usability expert Jacob Nielsen wrote2:

“The Web is turning into a low-trust society, hurting the honest sites.”

▪ Probably my favorite example of this is the story of photo-sharing website Flickr. In the early days, as it snowballed in popularity, Flickr suffered from continual server issues. Users were frustrated by the service often being down. Things came to a head when Flickr accidentally deleted some users’ images — permanently. As you can imagine, this led to a significant outcry and greatly reduced people’s trust in the service.

▪ Flickr had a choice to make. Should they turn to their terms and conditions to defend their liability, or adopt another approach? Fortunately, they realized that although their terms and conditions covered them legally, there was a more significant issue at stake — user’s trust.

▪ Instead of releasing a statement written by lawyers aimed at covering their liability, they posted to their blog an article titled ‘Sometimes We Suck3’. The post was a sincere and compelling apology. It did not attempt to sugarcoat what had happened or to make excuses. It laid out what went wrong, took full responsibility, and outlined the steps being taken to avoid it happening again. They were open, honest, and transparent.

▪ As one of the affected users, I can tell you from personal experience that the blog post went a long way in rebuilding my trust in the company, and I was not alone. Flickr turned me and others from prominent detractors into advocates for the brand. They went on to massive success before eventually selling to Yahoo! for $22 million.

▪ This disarming openness has grown in popularity, especially among tech startups. Other examples include social media platform Buffer and content management platform Ghost. Both companies are run with a staggering degree of openness. They publish all revenue and costs in real-time on their websites. Buffer even publishes the salaries of its employees and the diversity of its staff.

▪ Buffer publishes a staggering degree of information on company operations, so building the trust of users in the company.

▪ In usability testing on the Honestbee website, users were skeptical about why they needed to enter a postcode before viewing content. The site failed to explain its intent.

▪ The secret is to take small steps to open up and measure both the positive and negative impacts it has on the business. In many cases, people massively underestimate the benefits and overestimate the risks.

▪ And in Flickr’s case, it was not just honesty that resonated with users and built trust; it was also the company’s humanity and empathy.

▪ Those stock photographs of happy people that adorn many websites: yes, smiles do prime people into associating positive emotions with your product and services. But that only works if users interpret the images as sincere, something few stock photos achieve. Instead, these photographs come across as disingenuous and superficial at best, downright manipulative at worst. In either case, they undermine trust.

▪ The other typical example of this is the image of a customer service representative who often appears alongside phone numbers or live chat. Almost always, this is an attractive, smiling, younger woman eagerly waiting to hear from you. Why not show a photo of the real person? Sure, they might not be as photogenic (and you would need their cooperation and consent!), but at least it will be genuine and add a real human face to your business.

▪ Most e-commerce websites make extensive use of social proof in the form of ratings and reviews. Chances are that if you ever purchased from Amazon, you took a moment to read the reviews by other users. However, you were probably less likely to read the manufacturer’s description. You naturally favored the opinions of strangers over the manufacturer, perhaps because you feel they will be more objective or truthful.

▪ There are many more opportunities to take advantage of social proof beyond ratings and reviews. Testimonials can be compelling: somebody actively endorsing your product or service will encourage others to follow suit

▪ Unbounce is just one example of a company that makes excellent use of testimonials to add to its trustworthiness

▪ Many users are suspicious of the credibility of any testimonial or review. I’m sure you have felt the same when reading reviews on Amazon. How, then, do we prove to users that the social proof we are providing is genuine?

▪ Ensuring the user has heard of the source of any social proof is a good starting point. It is even possible in some situations to include endorsements from the user’s friends. For example, you can highlight if the user’s friends on social media have liked your product or service.

▪ Rely on Numbers

Failing that, it is possible to fall back on numbers. That is an advantage Amazon can offer. According to research carried out by the Baymard Institute4, people tend to trust large numbers of reviews over a handful, as any fake reviews would be crowded out and lost in the noise. That is why it is so important to show the number of reviews.

▪ Baymard’s findings showed that people favored a lower rating when supported by more reviews.

▪ By mentioning both third-party recognition and the number of people who voted, Tesla makes good use of social proof.

▪ Don’t Remove Negative Reviews

That said, we tend to be suspicious if all reviews are glowingly positive. Be sure to include less complimentary comments. Their presence reinforces the authenticity of the positive ones.

▪ Use Social Media

Using testimonials from social media works particularly well because you can link back to the source. That affords the more skeptical user the opportunity to check out the reviewer’s social media profile and prove to themselves they are a real person.

▪ Being able to imagine Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak starting Apple from a plain old suburban garage softens the corporate monster Apple is today.

▪ For years I had an extreme dislike of Microsoft. As somebody passionate about web standards, I was not too fond of Internet Explorer 6 and its dominance of the browser market back in the day. Years went by without an update for this out-of-date browser, and it was holding back the adoption of CSS. Many other developers were becoming increasingly vitriolic in their attacks on the company.

Then, out of nowhere, Microsoft launched a developer blog called Channel 9. Developers ran this blog within Microsoft and, alongside useful advice, it also gave me glimpses into life within the organization and the people behind the brand. Suddenly it was much harder to remain antagonistic about the organization because I began to realize there were human beings behind that corporate facade. By telling their stories and describing the challenges they faced, you began to empathize and sympathize with them. They began to build rapport and trust by being open and accessible.

▪ I would encourage you to look for stories within your organization. Maybe it is the story of how the idea for your product came about. Perhaps it is about how you worked with a past customer. Consider telling the story of a member of staff who went above and beyond in their job.

▪ One example of this was a package I received out of the blue one day from Mailchimp, the company I used to send my email newsletters. It contained a woolly hat based on their mascot, Freddie the chimpanzee. With the hat came a note thanking me for being a customer. The fact that the gift arrived completely unsolicited and unexpectedly had a positive impact on me. Minutes later, I had taken to Twitter, posting a photo of my son wearing the hat and thanking Mailchimp.

▪ Yet it’s important to remember that the very first experience customers have with our products defines and shapes an overall initial impression, and it’s likely to damage your relationship if not done well.

▪ A study published in the journal Behavior and Information Technology8 indicated that a user forms an initial impression of a website in as little as 50 milliseconds! What is more, this initial impression doesn’t change much after seeing the site for an extended period.

▪ If a design doesn’t establish the right first impression, it can seriously undermine how a user perceives your organization and how much they trust you.

▪ When it comes to trustworthiness, attention to detail matters. One participant in usability testing once said to me, after stumbling across a broken link:

“Oh, that didn’t work. I also spotted several typos earlier. They obviously aren’t good at detail. If they can’t even get it right on their website, it makes me nervous about hiring them.”

▪ Typos, broken links, images not loading, JavaScript throwing errors: all undermine credibility and communicate an overall lack of attention to detail. But it is not enough for your site not to break; it also has to strike the right visual tone.

▪ To make a good first impression, we need to meet the expectation that customers have about the design to the fullest extent, if possible

▪ For a website to elicit trust, it should find a balance between the personality, tone, colors, typography, photography, layout, microcopy, and everything in between. It’s not an easy task to do, and it needs a consistent, well-defined visual language that communicates well on your behalf.

▪ To ensure that a design conveys the right impressions, we need to test it with real users — and the earlier in the product’s evolution, the better.

▪ A five-second test is an excellent approach for judging the trustworthiness and professionalism of a design. Show participants the design for five seconds and then ask them:

“On a scale of 1–5, how trustworthy did you find the design? (Where 1 is not at all trustworthy and 5 is extremely trustworthy.)”

▪ UsabilityHub makes it easy to run five-second tests. They will even recruit appropriate participants.

▪ Take a moment to look at your homepage. Identify all the actions a user could take, from links to other pages, to forms or product selection. Now, for each element, ask yourself whether you could remove it. If you can’t remove it without damaging your conversion rate, could you wait to show it to the user?

▪ A confusing and inconsistent site will significantly reduce perceived trustworthiness. That is especially true when the website does not match the user’s mental model. They are left with the impression that the organization doesn’t understand them or their needs.

▪ Design inconsistencies can also feel disconcerting and make users feel uncomfortable. That can stem from stylistic differences such as fonts or color. However, the bigger problem is inconsistencies in layout and behavior, where the interface behaves in unexpected ways

▪ I vividly remember when I learned to drive. I couldn’t understand how anybody could manage it. There were so many things to think about simultaneously. You had to concentrate on the road while changing gear, signalling, checking mirrors, and what felt like a dozen other things. It was utterly overwhelming! And it felt awful. I was tired, frustrated, out of my depth, and in a bad mood. It was just hard work!

▪ These days, I can arrive at a place I drive to often and have no recollection of how I got there. Not only was I not conscious of driving, but I also wasn’t even aware of much of the route. It’s terrifying!

▪ In his superb book Thinking, Fast and Slow1, Daniel Kahneman introduces us to two mental processes, called System 1 and System 2.

▪ We see the same happening with websites we use frequently, and it’s why sites like Amazon feel so intuitive. We have used them so much we can use them without waking System 2.

▪ Although Amazon has changed its site over the years, it has done so incrementally to not overwhelm existing customers

▪ It is also why regular users of a site go into meltdown every time its owner changes it. Suddenly they can no longer rely on System 1 to use the site. It is the website equivalent of replacing all of the controls in a car — and that raises our cognitive load.

▪ Psychologists refer to this as cognitive load, which refers to the amount of mental effort a person is exerting at any one time. The higher our cognitive load, the harder our System 2 is having to work. It is a significant contributor to users abandoning sites without completing calls to action.

▪ The problem is that what appears simple to you isn’t necessarily for your users. You have looked at your website a thousand times, and so it is intuitive in your eyes. But that is for the same reason that driving is easy when you have been driving for years.

▪ Most usability testing is not a fair reflection of the real world. During usability testing, a user is often in a quiet environment free from distractions, and they are being paid to give a site their full attention. At the very least, they give the site more attention than they usually would because they are being observed and asked questions.

▪ The real world is a different place. From crying babies, noisy train stations, limited time, and too many options, our cognitive load is often already high when we visit a website. That makes our tolerance for even minor barriers extremely low. That is why, whenever possible, it is good to test with people in a variety of situations

▪ Increasingly we are interacting with websites in environments that mean we already have a high cognitive load. Usability testing often does not reflect this.

▪ Then there are the accessibility considerations that can also increase cognitive load. People with a cognitive disability like dyslexia will experience a higher cognitive burden on a website. Even those with a physical disability like a broken arm or poor eyesight will probably experience higher cognitive load too as they struggle to manage that impairment. How do we avoid adding to our user’s cognitive load?

▪ To give you an example of procedural memory, ask yourself how you would search on a website. Chances are you would come up with something like this:

1. Look in the top-right corner of a site.

2. Click on the input box you find there.

3. Enter your search term.

4. Click the submit button next to the input field.

▪ Although not strictly necessary, Google keeps its search button because it knows many users’ procedural knowledge relies on it.

▪ That is why carrying out site redesigns can be dangerous. When you start changing things on your site, there is a possibility that you will break the procedures your repeat users have for interacting with the website. That almost always results in complaints and a short-term decline in sales.

▪ In other words, avoid moving elements around too much and be careful to clearly explain to users what has changed and how.

▪ For example, you might want to consider an onboarding overlay to show how you have repositioned functionality in the interface. Alternatively, you could take a leaf from Jira’s book: they used an animated GIF when they redesigned their software to show users how screen elements had moved.

▪ Finally, you could allow users to switch back to the old design, at least for a while

▪ Instead of asking ourselves, “Is this website trustworthy?” we ask, “Does this website work like other trustworthy websites I have used?”

▪ In some ways, this feels counterintuitive. Ask anybody, and they will tell you they want lots of choice. Yet too many options overwhelm us, and often we fail to make a decision.

▪ The response to too much choice is so predictable that something called Hick’s law2 can predict it to a high degree of accuracy. Hick’s law shows us that the more choices we offer a user, the longer it will take for them to decide. That increases the chance they abandon the decision entirely, as has been proved by numerous psychological studies.

▪ The same is true for website navigation. The more of something there is, the narrower the distinction between each option. It is that lack of difference that makes it even harder for users to know what choice to select.

▪ If you have more than one choice, make sure they are distinct. If they are too similar, users will not choose.

▪ The average website bombards users with calls to action competing for their attention. Just some of the many requests we make of users include:

•Sign up for our newsletter

•Follow us on social media

•Share this page

•Contact us

•Buy this

•Approve our privacy policy

•Read this overlay

•Complete this survey

•Install our app

▪ The number of times I have been to a website looking to buy, only to be interrupted by an overlay asking me to sign up for a newsletter. At face value, this sounds reasonable, but when you think about it, it is insanity.

▪ I am not saying that secondary calls to action like signing up for a newsletter are unimportant. I am merely saying that we need to prioritize and make sure we do not overwhelm users with options. The problem is that we often fail to think about the experience holistically

▪ For example, we see that many users visit our site and then leave without buying. Our solution to this problem is to ask them to sign up for the newsletter. However, we fail to consider the impact of that on other calls to action.

▪ For example, we might only show a newsletter overlay on exit. That way, we know the user has already done whatever brought them to the site. Alternatively, we could promote different calls to action depending on how many times somebody has come to our website. What we shouldn’t do is throw all of our calls to action at the user simultaneously and hope they pick the one that best applies. That will not happen.

▪ In 2008, Transport for London ran a cyclist awareness campaign in an attempt to lower the number of cars hitting cyclists. Part of the campaign involved a compelling cinema and online ad3 that demonstrated how easy it was to miss something we initially consider to be blindingly evident.

▪ The viewer’s cognitive load was so high as they tried to count passes that they missed the bear entirely. The ad pointed out that if you could not notice a moonwalking bear, you could easily not see a cyclist.

▪ The ad was based on psychological experiments that had been around for years to demonstrate the impact of cognitive load. It is an experiment that applies as much to us as digital professionals, as it does to drivers on the road

▪ We begin by splitting the stakeholders into teams and getting them brainstorming as many screen elements as they can think of for any particular page. I encourage them to be as specific as possible. For example, instead of writing “header,” write down each element in the header. This initial exercise gives all of the stakeholders a chance to express their ideas and include them for consideration

▪ At the same time, however, it also reveals the extent of the problem: just how many items will be demanding the user’s attention.

▪ I drive that point home further using some research carried out by Microsoft4. This research suggests that the average web user has an attention span of about eight seconds. That means we have eight seconds to communicate our key messages.

▪ How accurate or otherwise this number is doesn’t matter. More important is the principle that we have a limited time to communicate, and that is something most people accept.

▪ I then suggest we represent that limited attention as points. As a rough guide, I suggest that users can probably process two or three items in a second. Again, how accurate these numbers are isn’t strictly relevant. That means if we have about eight seconds and they can look at about three items in a second that equates to 24 points of user attention

▪ Each element we add to the page will take at least one point of user attention. However, if you want people to pay more attention to one element over another, then it has to be given more points. So if your privacy policy uses one point, then your primary call to action will need at least two.

▪ Now I encourage the groups to go back through their list awarding points as they see fit. This forces them to remove some items entirely and make some tough decisions about priorities. But even this exercise won’t go far enough. Inevitably the stakeholders will spread their points extremely thinly, with the vast majority of items only having one point, with the occasional sprinkling of two-point items

▪ I point out how Google has spent the vast majority of its points on its branding and search box. Yahoo!, by comparison, has spread its user attention points around the page. I then gently explain they have prioritized like Yahoo! and not Google. For many, this is a light-bulb moment, where the theory of cognitive overload becomes a reality

▪ Because that is what reducing cognitive load is about. It is about making the tough decisions about what to put in front of users, knowing that every item added will slightly increase their load. I find having a mechanism for making these decisions, helps me make them with less effort and ensures the interfaces I design place the emphasis on the right things.

▪ The approach I use hinges on a single principle — every screen element and every piece of content has to justify its inclusion. That is in stark contrast to how most organizations approach the web. Because posting online is easy, there is the attitude of “Why not include it? Somebody might find it useful.”

▪ Then there are the elements whose removal will not change the user experience or ability to convert, but will alienate an internal stakeholder. These are the trickiest to deal with, and I won’t pretend I have any magic answers

▪ If you cannot remove an item, you need to ask yourself “Can I hide it?” What if you moved that element deeper into the site structure? What about if you put it under an accordion or tab?

▪ If you cannot reduce the choice, at least hide less popular options

▪ It helps them see that you do not encourage people to complete a secondary call to action by plastering it all over your site. Instead, timing is everything. If you can get stakeholders to grasp that picking their moment to ask users to act will be more productive, it will go a long way to reducing clutter.

▪ Too often, I see organizations making the mistake of trying to facilitate the needs of edge cases at the cost of the majority. I am not saying you ignore secondary audiences. But they might have to work slightly harder to access their content so as not to undermine the experience of the majority.

▪ We can guide the user’s attention to some elements over others using good design. Equally, we can use design to remove emphasis from less essential items. Size and position are your two primary tools to achieve this.. We can use color too, but there is a danger you undermine accessibility if you rely on it too heavily.

▪ To reduce the chances of an element drawing attention away from more critical content, you can either make it visually smaller or put it lower on the page. The classic example of this is the kind of content you find in the footer of most websites. These simple text links are unassuming and are the last thing people see on a page.

▪ The footer is an excellent place to display content that cannot be removed for legal or compliance reasons.

▪ Of course, you need to be careful, as approximately 1 in 12 men, and 1 in 200 women are color-blind. So although we should use color, we need to consider accessibility if we want it to be effective.

▪ I have already talked about how people expect to find search in the top right-hand corner of a site and that it has become a learnt behavior to look there.

▪ That kind of context matters a lot when it comes to positioning. Not only will the placement of the calls to action in the content flow matter, but so will their relationship with other screen elements. For example, the fewer elements close to the call to action, the more likely users are to spot it. That is why designers favor negative space so heavily and why you will see the smallest mark on a white wall. There is nothing else to draw the eye away.

▪ We tend to follow the gaze of people in photos. If the person in a photograph is looking towards a call to action, the image can help draw attention to it.

▪ And it is not just lines of sight that we tend to follow. Any strong indication of line or direction will also draw the eye. That means arrows or similar direction lines can be used to draw attention. Equally, a strong vertical or horizontal line can block the user’s gaze from progressing.

▪ Of course, what delights me may not delight you. You might find the Smashing Membership design loud and annoying. That is why testing with your target audience is so important

▪ Once again, a simple five-second test would work great here. Show the user the design for five seconds and ask them to rank it on criteria such as positivity, appeal, or any other keyword you are seeking to engender.

▪ It turned out that the company operated a franchise model where different franchises were responsible for fulfilment in different parts of the country. That proved a problem because each franchise could set its own prices. The way the company solved this on the website was to display the average price and then adjust it when the user entered their postcode. They did their best to make this clear to the user, but it caused much confusion and, not surprisingly, anger. In the usability testing, I discovered that those who saw a price increase on entering their postcode interpreted this as a hidden delivery charge. They felt that the site lied about free delivery.

That is the problem of perception. It doesn’t matter whether the user’s feelings are justified or not; it will still lose you the sale. The way we overcame the issue was to reframe the user’s perception of what was happening. Instead of displaying the average price, we posted the highest price by default. Then, when the user entered their postcode, the majority were offered a discounted price, which people readily accepted, without questioning why they were receiving it.

▪ Fortunately, the fact that the solution was easy to implement technically worked in our favor. We were able to run a test on a small segment of our users. Although we did see a decline in people adding products to their baskets, we saw a significant decrease in the number of people abandoning their baskets before checkout. That worked out as a net gain in revenue, which was enough to win over management.

▪ There are a few lessons to learn from this story. The first mistake the company made was giving the customer a sense of loss. We have already talked about how keenly people feel a sense of loss, and the practice of charging some users more when they entered a postcode triggered this. Users perceived the increase in price as a loss over what they initially expected to pay.

▪ Of course, there are ethical questions about how far you should go in altering a user’ perception of the value of your products and services. For the franchise company, we believed that the average price was creating a false impression that we wanted to correct. By showing the highest price and then lowering it, we used the higher cost to reframe how users saw the final price. Suddenly it looked like a bargain.

▪ ConvertKit reframes the evaluation with Mailchimp away from price and on to features.

▪ Not only is email marketing extremely competitive, but ConvertKit also charges more than the market leader. A direct comparison on price does not reflect favorably. To combat this problem, ConvertKit reframes the comparison away from price and towards features.

▪ They do this by showing an easy to digest table that directly compares ConvertKit’s features with Mailchimp. Doing so makes ConvertKit’s offering look attractive and worth the extra cost.

▪ As the name implies, this involves showing the user a webpage for only five seconds. You then ask the user various questions about what they have seen. In our case, we asked a straightforward question: “Based on what you have seen, do you believe this is a university for people like you?”

▪ If I were to tell you that Karen was going to visit the bank, what would you expect Karen to be doing? Most people presume that Karen would be going to withdraw some money or apply for a loan. A few humorous individuals always suggest she might be going to rob the bank. However, if you were an angler, you might think of a riverbank, rather than a financial institution. Your mental model will be different, and so your associations with the word “bank” will be different.

▪ If you want to produce content that resonates with users and creates a positive perception, you need to involve users in the process. The best people to create content that connects with your audience are your users.

▪ For me, this often begins with surveying users to find out what their questions and objections are relating to a product or service I am looking to sell

▪ Userdrive is an excellent tool for running card sorting online.

▪ If you haven’t run open card sorting before, don’t worry; it is incredibly straightforward. All you need to do is print each of those top 30 questions onto individual cards and ask users to group them in whatever way makes sense to them

▪ Once they have organized the questions into groups, you then ask them to label each group using one or two words.

▪ Doing this straightforward exercise will give you a sense of the user’s mental model and it can form the basis of your top-level information architecture.

▪ Once I have identified those top-level sections, I then often run a closed card sorting exercise. Once again, this involves printing each question on a card. However, this time I print all the questions out, not just the top 30. I ask the user to place all of the cards in the top-level sections you have previously agreed

▪ That will help validate your top sections and also helps me understand what I should add where.

▪ Involving users doesn’t need to stop there. You can also include them in answering those questions too

▪ Gather a group of users together in a room, along with an equal number of internal stakeholders. Now pin all of the questions onto the wall. Split the group into pairs, with one user and one internal stakeholder in each pair. Next, ask each group to pick a question to answer and then draft an answer to the question together.

▪ The answer will not be perfect or even well written. It may contain inaccuracies or miss crucial details. But, it is a starting point for final website copy, and you can refine it later.

▪ Testing is so fundamental to successfully improving conversion that these are challenges we will have to overcome, as we will explore in the next chapter.

▪ Imagine having a meeting to discuss the design of a home page. How many people would be in the room and how long would the meeting run? Let’s be kind and say there were only five people in the room, and you were able to decide in an hour. That is five person-hours of effort to decide on a direction. The average salary for somebody working in marketing or digital is about $61,000 in the United States1. Most employees work approximately 1,800 hours a year. That means they cost about $34 an hour. $34 times five people in the room makes $170. Even with the time it took me to set up the test, it works out cheaper to run a test than have a meeting. It will also be approximately the same time too.

▪ However, although running testing will help cut through the endless debate, that isn’t the primary reason for doing it. The real reason to test is that no amount of discussion or even expertise will get you to a highly converting website.

▪ People who run high converting websites don’t then buy another book on conversion for the next set of useful tips. Instead, they have a robust process of testing and iteration that systematically improves their conversion rate over time

▪ I want to explain when to test and how to go about getting useful results. I want to look at testing a new digital service and then go on to explore how to improve the conversion rate of that service post-launch in a systematic way.

▪ If you think about it, the way most of us run digital projects is ridiculous. They usually begin with somebody in senior management having “a great idea.” The manager often bases their idea on little beyond intuition and experience. The idea is also often lacking in detail. It then falls to others to flesh out what that idea means in practice. Typically, the project will have an impact on multiple stakeholders, and so a committee is formed to realize the vision. Bizarrely, this group of stakeholders often excludes the people who will design and build the project.

▪ The result of this is that when the team does finally launch the digital service, nobody knows if it will be a success or not. Nobody has any idea of whether it is delivering what the user needs or whether it will address any of the questions or concerns the user has. Nobody even knows if people will understand it.

▪ How do you know that a new idea will resonate?

In most cases, organizations don’t. Instead, they guess, hoping that if they invest in enough ideas, one of them will work and cover the cost of the others. Occasionally an organization will do some market research. However, that is notoriously inaccurate.

▪ Consumers will often show interest in a hypothetical product and yet will be unwilling to part with money when the moment comes to buy. It is only at the moment of making a real purchase that our primitive brain wakes up. Only then does it feel a sense of loss that comes from parting with real money. That sense of loss is not triggered by a hypothetical situation.

▪ An alternative is to test the market for an idea with a small initial investment. A technique I favor is to create a simple, single landing page for the product you are considering selling that attempts to sell the product as if it were real. If that is an existing product, it would be a page that takes the essence of your proposed approach for the promotion and attempts to showcase it.

▪ You can build a landing page in a couple of hours using a tool like Leadpages2.

▪ In either case, this single page would have a call to action asking users to buy the product or make some other real commitment. Only if users think they are making a true commitment will you get a realistic idea of whether they would be willing to buy

▪ When the user clicks the call to action, instead of making that commitment, the copy can tell the user that the product hasn’t yet been launched and asks them for their email address so that you can inform them when it does go live.

▪ Now, I accept that from a usability standpoint, this is a terrible experience. A user clicking on a buy button, and then being asked for an email address instead, is a difficult transition. But getting users to part with money is even harder, so despite this somewhat jarring experience, it will give you some indication of how viable your idea is.

▪ The secret is to keep the initial investment low. Use a tool like Leadpages to build the landing page or buy a theme. Focus on getting the messaging or copy as compelling as possible.

▪ A variation of this approach is to launch a product on a crowdsourcing site like Kickstarter. Even big brands like Bose are using these sites to test interest in new products and to refine their approach to selling those products.

▪ Even Bose has used this technique to judge interest on crowdfunding site Indiegogo.

▪ Presuming the idea passes these tests and makes it to the top of the development backlog, the next hurdle is to ensure you adopt the right design approach.

▪ I envy the confidence of some designers and marketers. They present designs and copy to their clients, confident they have come up with the definitive approach for improving conversion. Personally, in 23 years of designing digital services, I have not once created a landing page I was happy with on my first attempt

▪ That said, for myself at least, there are three tests I like to run when experimenting with design approaches. These are:

•the five-second test

•a semantic differential survey

•the first-click test

▪ I mentioned this form of testing in chapters 6 and 8. It involves showing a user a web page or user interface for only a few seconds before it is hidden, and you ask them questions about what they have seen

▪ A five-second test is a useful way of ascertaining whether somebody gets the basic topic of a website.

▪ A semantic differential survey is a grandiose name for a simple idea. It allows the user to grade a design against specific keywords. For example, you might ask, “On a scale of 1–5 how trustworthy do you find this site?” Not that you are limited to asking about trustworthiness. You could ask how compelling it was or how it communicated.

▪ One of my favorite uses of a semantic differential survey is to judge whether a design communicates the right kind of “feeling” in the user. Before I start designing, I agree on a list of keywords that we want the design to communicate. For example, the client might want to express that their brand is friendly or loyal. Once I have completed the design, I run a semantic differential survey and ask users how they would rate the design based on these criteria. That proves a great way of reassuring the client and myself that the design is heading in the right direction.

▪ If your design ranks well both on the do-they-get-it test and in terms of how it feels, then you are halfway there. However, the other significant factor is whether users can get the answers they need from the site.

▪ As we have already established, users have questions and objections that prevent them from acting. Even if they resolve these to their satisfaction, they need to know how to respond. That means a page needs to offer clear signposting. It needs to be obvious how users can get answers and how they can then take action.

▪ Of course, testing this with a static design mock-up is not easy. We cannot ask users to navigate the site because that site does not yet exist. Instead, we can run the first-click test.

▪ One of the most influential studies into usability, “FirstClick Usability Testing3” by Bob Bailey and Cari Wolfson, delved into the importance of the user’s first click being correct. Their findings showed that if the first click was right, users had an 87% chance of completing the action correctly, as opposed to just 46% if the first click was wrong.

▪ A first-click test, therefore, asks users where they would click to complete specific tasks, such as getting an answer to a question, or clicking on a call to action. If the user makes the correct selection, you can then be confident in your design.

▪ What is more, all three are straightforward to run. I run all of these tests using UsabilityHub4 that allows me to run the tests online in a matter of minutes.

▪ You pay $1 per participant and get results back in an average of about an hour. With this kind of testing becoming so easy and cheap, it is ridiculous not to test the effectiveness of designs.

▪ We shouldn’t just be testing design concepts, however. We should be checking throughout the build process, starting with your initial prototypes.

▪ Test From Prototype to Minimum Viable Product

▪ Prototyping provides an opportunity to establish three things:

1. Can users find the information they require to make a decision?

2. Did the information they find prove successful in persuading them?

3. Can they quickly complete the call to action with minimum cognitive load?

▪ In essence, we are testing the usability of your prototype and its persuasiveness. That is something you will repeat and expand on as you build the final website.

▪ I have mentioned usability testing several times through this book, but I know that many consider it beyond what they can do in their projects due to budgetary or time constraints. It’s a position I sympathize with, even though I work with large organizations such as Puma, Doctors Without Borders or GlaxoSmithKline, which you would think would have the budget for testing. I still meet resistance to usability testing; somehow there never seems to be the time or budget.

▪ Although I don’t always get to do the kind of usability testing I want, I still manage to do something and, in my opinion, something is better than nothing

▪ Too often, usability testing is associated with expensive user research agencies, eye tracking, specialized usability labs and statistically significant groups of participants who are all exactly the right kind of person.

▪ In his excellent books, Don’t Make Me Think and Rocket Surgery Made Easy, Steve Krug lays out a lightweight approach to testing

▪ Krug proposes setting aside one morning every month for usability testing. In that morning, he recommends testing with three participants, using nothing more than a computer with a webcam and some testing software.

▪ He encourages you to invite as many stakeholders as possible to view the sessions from another room. That includes developers, designers, copywriters, project managers, or anybody else who might be interested

▪ If you cannot persuade people to attend initially, record the sessions and send them edited highlights. In my experience, this will grab their attention, and with luck they will then participate next month.

▪ After the sessions, sit down over lunch and discuss what lessons you have learned and how you can make things better. That’s it!

▪ Yes, you could create a formal process or system for tracking usability hurdles and whether they have been fixed or not. But that is overkill for all but the biggest and most experienced teams

▪ By keeping it lightweight and informal, it is much more likely to happen and happen regularly

▪ With regular testing, you can incrementally improve your service over time

▪ Each round of testing will uncover new issues that were not picked up before or have been added in since. That is why it is good to continue testing from initial prototype to the launch and beyond.

▪ Research carried out by Jacob Nielsen5 found that testing with three people will catch about 75% of the usability challenges in each round of testing.

▪ Anything more than about five people and the number of new issues found will diminish dramatically

▪ Not only that, but the three people don’t even need to match your customer’s exact demographics. Don’t get me wrong; it is better if you can get real prospects. However, anybody outside of your project and company would be perfectly adequate because, when testing usability, most of us will struggle with the same challenges.

▪ Only if you are testing the young or old will you find unique requirements that others might not have.

▪ Even better, you don’t need to be in the room with participants to test with them. Remote testing works well too, and you can do it with an app like Skype or Zoom

▪ Lookback is one of my favorite tools for recording both in-person and remote usability testing.

▪ Even recruitment can be made easier using a service like TestingTime7 that will help you find participants for both in-person and remote testing.

▪ In short, you can run testing cheaply and quickly, so there is no reason not to make it a part of your conversion rate optimization workflow.

▪ As for what you cover when running usability testing, that depends on what you are doing at the time. If you are prototyping, you are trying to establish whether users can find the answers they need and whether they find the call to action simple to use.

▪ When I was working with an e-learning company that sold online training, I started by asking participants what they would want to know before they would be willing to enrol in a course. What would they expect the website to tell them? Starting sessions like this, before they even see the site, is a chance to sanity-check the content on the website. Have I identified the right questions and objections?

▪ I then usually asked the participants to pick a particular question they might have and ask them to find the answer to that question on the website.

▪ For example, if they wanted to know how long a typical course would take to complete, I ask them to find that information, encouraging them to speak out loud about what they think as they complete the task.

▪ Some participants will have questions you had never considered, while others will be unable to find the answer to their question despite it being clear to you. Still others will discover their answer, but find it unconvincing. That last response is particularly poignant when considering conversion rate optimization. It is not enough that your website is usable, it also needs to be persuasive, and so that is something we need to test as well.

▪ Participants are often keen to please (especially if you are paying them) and so will be more positive about your offering than they would be in normal circumstances. Even if they are honest with you, there is a big difference between asking somebody if they would be willing to act and them taking action when they would incur a real cost. People are a lot more risk-averse in the real world.

▪ One way around the problem is to end a session with an offer. I completed the session of testing for the e-learning website by asking people if they would be interested in signing up for a course there and then for a substantial discount. Their answer gave me an indication of just how persuasive the site was.

▪ If people were willing to pay some price (no matter how small) it was an indication that things were looking positive.

▪ I ask people if there was anything about the site that annoyed them. If they start talking about how manipulative it was or that it made them feel pressured, then we are on dangerous ground.

▪ This kind of usability testing will act as your compass during development, ensuring that your content is relevant, easy to access and compelling. We can use it on a simple prototype through to launching your minimum viable product. Notice that I refer to a minimum viable product, not your final website. That is for a good reason.

▪ The web is not the same as print — a simple fact we so often forget. Time and again, I see companies treating the launch of a sales website in much the same way they would send a brochure to print

▪ Such an approach fails to account for the two most exceptional characteristics of digital when compared to print:

▪ •It is relatively easy to update.

▪ •It provides unprecedented amounts of data on user behavior

▪ That is why I refer to launching a minimum viable product, rather than a final website. Instead of struggling with producing the perfect website for launch, we should instead focus on providing the most straightforward version we can get away with and then evolving that website based on the data we receive about user behavior.

▪ After all, it is not until we put our website out into the real world that we truly know how it will perform and whether it will convince users to take action.

▪ However, a minimum viable product doesn’t mean poor quality, rushed products. It is not about launching shoddy design work or draft copy. Instead, a minimum viable product refers to a highly focused product that does a small number of things well.

▪ That kind of focus can come in several forms. One option would be to focus your minimum viable product on serving a specific audience, rather than launching a much larger website that attempts to cater for the complete range of people who might be interested in your product or service

▪ By adopting this approach, you can refine your offering and messaging before attempting to attract a broader audience.

▪ The second approach is to focus on promoting a subset of the benefits or addressing the largest of the objections users have. Many websites struggle because they try to communicate too much information to users. By keeping the site focused when you launch it, you can get to market faster, and better measure the impact of expanding the website with additional content over time.

▪ The final way to keep your minimum viable product focused is to avoid introducing too many calls to action. That is good practice in any case, but it also prevents your first version trying to do too much

▪ For example, let us imagine you are trying to sell a piece of software. No doubt you will be keen to ask users to subscribe to a newsletter so that you can keep in touch with people who are not immediately ready to buy. However, when launching a minimum viable product, it makes sense to exclude these secondary actions.

▪ That keeps your website focused and avoids building sign-up forms or writing a regular newsletter. You can always add this functionality later.

▪ The approach I adopt is a three-step process, consisting of:

1. Identifying where the website is underperforming.

2. Forming a hypothesis about why it is underperforming.

3. Testing possible fixes to the problem.

▪ Site analytics is an invaluable tool in identifying where the shortcomings in your website occur. Unfortunately, few people use analytics to their full potential. Instead, they launch Google Analytics, look at the default dashboards and take a vague interest in whether the numbers have gone up or down

▪ In our case, we want an answer to a specific question, and that helps us make the most of analytics. We want to know where on our site we are losing people.

▪ However, we cannot merely look at a list of exit pages. We will first need to filter out people who hit the site and then almost immediately leave. No amount of conversion rate optimization is going to recover a user who spends less than five seconds on your website. In those situations, you need to improve the targeting of your marketing and address site performance.

▪ Once we have filtered our results, we should end up with a list of top exit pages. We can now start with the most popular exit page and start working down the list.

▪ Once we have our top exit page, we need to work out why people are abandoning that page. I usually start by watching some session recordings. Using a tool like FullStory8 or Hotjar9, I can identify users who abandoned the site after viewing the exit page and watch videos of them navigating that page.

▪ These anonymous videos allow me to see how much they scrolled, where they clicked, what they spent time looking at, and what they hovered over. I can also see the page exactly as they saw it.

▪ Often, watching a few of these sessions is enough to allow me to form a hypothesis about why users might be abandoning the page. Sometimes it could be because the page is rendering poorly for these users; other times it might be that they scroll right past some critical piece of information without noticing it. These videos can reveal a wide range of problems.

▪ Another approach is to intercept users using a tool like Ethnio10. Instead of asking them if they would complete a survey, you ask them if they will take part in some usability testing. Ethnio will then enable them to schedule a time to run the session.

▪ Just because you know what the problem is doesn’t mean you necessarily know the best way to solve it.

▪ You may identify several different solutions that could help. Working out which of those solutions will work best depends on the site you are testing. Specifically, it depends on the amount of traffic you have.

▪ The way that the likes of Amazon, Booking.com and other big-name sites approach identifying the right solution is through A/B testing. A/B testing is an excellent tool for experimenting with different possible solutions, and it is free to get started thanks to tools like Google Optimize11.

▪ Be careful, though, as A/B testing can come with a performance hit that could reduce conversion.

▪ Another problem with this approach is that you (probably) do not have the traffic levels of Amazon or Booking.com. That means that you don’t have enough people to show different versions of the headline and see whether the change impacts the conversion rate.

▪ Not that this entirely rules out A/B testing for lower-traffic websites. You will just have to approach it differently

▪ Google famously tested 15 different shades of blue to find out which one performed the best — but you are not Google

▪ The best-designed interface in the world, even when combined with the most compelling copy, will not be enough if the product and overall experience are inferior.

▪ Many teams are held responsible for improving online conversion. Yet the tools at their disposal to achieve this are limited to tweaks to the user interface and copy. That will not be enough to get the job done.

▪ However, it is not only copy and design that influence the effectiveness of your website as a conversion tool. For example, I wrote about the role performance plays in improving conversion. If your website is slow to load, it will have an enormous impact on the number of users taking action, even if they hang around long enough to see the call to action in the first place.

▪ Not only that, but poor performance will lower your search engine rankings, preventing users from finding your website in the first place.

▪ Too often, we get our priorities wrong when designing a website for conversion. We focus on aesthetics, introducing lots of imagery and fonts, and although these elements can help encourage clicks, they cannot be allowed to compromise the performance of a site.

▪ First and foremost, a high-converting website must be accessible (which here means fast to render), then it must be relevant and usable. Only after those things are in place do we start working on improving a site’s persuasiveness

▪ Organizations routinely underestimate the return that improving accessibility for disabled people can generate.

▪ For example, the US Department of Labor estimates that disabled people in the US have $175 billion in discretionary spending1.

▪ With one in five Americans having some form of disability, this is not an audience we can afford to ignore.

▪ For a start, the vast majority of people who reach middle age begin to have some form of eyesight problems. Also, as we age, motor skill problems from arthritis and other conditions become increasingly common.

▪ Almost all of us have either a temporary or situational disability many times during our lives. We may break an arm or get an eye infection, both of which would be examples of temporary disabilities.

▪ Alternatively, we might struggle to see due to screen glare or have to navigate a website one-handed because we are holding our child

▪ Ignorance and shortsightedness around accessibility provide a competitive advantage to organizations that seriously address it, rather than just conforming to legal minimums.

▪ One common factor of both accessibility and performance is that developers primarily shape them

▪ When thinking about improving conversion, few think about the work of developers; instead, they focus on the quality of work that marketers, copywriters, and designers produce. In reality, developers have a massive impact on the conversion level you will see from your website.

▪ Unlike many login forms, Mailchimp’s does not just tell me I have got my username wrong; it gives me help to correct the problem.

▪ Next, I formatted the postcode in all lowercase and again it didn’t work. That didn’t surprise me as people rarely write postcodes in lowercase. Then I tried entering the postcode in lowercase but with a space — still nothing. After many, many attempts, I found the problem. The developer’s validation rules required the postcode to be all lowercase. Although I had tried that, what I didn’t realize was that my mobile browser was automatically capitalizing the first letter.

I couldn’t help wondering how much money the airline was losing because of this one mistake, not to mention the costs associated with all of the additional support queries that the company must be receiving.

▪ Although CAPTCHA has improved somewhat over recent years, it still regularly requires users to complete security challenges, especially on mobile devices. That means it can often create a stumbling block that puts users off progressing

▪ CAPTCHA still requires people to complete security challenges by identifying parts of an image, such as storefronts or crosswalks. It happens often when you change locations or submit multiple inquiries one after another.

▪ The power of this approach is that social media and email are doing a lot of the heavy lifting in the sales cycle.

▪ Often the best way of improving the conversion of your product or service is to make the product or service better. Sometimes that means reevaluating the core offering itself. It may be that there isn’t an audience for what you provide or that the market is replete with better things. Often, however, it is not the core offering, but the broader experience that is at fault.

▪ Nevertheless, it is vital that you are aware of and can communicate with colleagues about these broader issues. That is because if you do not make it clear to management that there are other factors in play, you will be the one blamed when the website fails to convert!

▪ To do that you need to be able to measure success. There is no point making improvements to the site until you have a mechanism to measure whether those improvements work or not

▪ In the early days, you will find a lot of things on your site that can be improved, and that will have a significant positive impact on your conversion rate. However, as you fix these issues, it will be harder and harder to maintain the same level of growth. As a result, it is essential to manage stakeholders expectations right from the outset

▪ If you do manage to make a lot of big early wins, make it clear that this won’t last.

▪ In the early days, there will be clear barriers to overcome, such as long load time or easy to miss calls to action. Over time, however, barriers will become more challenging to identify and address. They will be intrinsic to the offering itself, not just the website. You will only identify them by having clear metrics coupled with an overview of the entire customer journey.
